My museum walk represented in accelerometer and gyro readings.
The positioning of the coordinates depends on the x, y, and z readings.

## Combined Visualization

This is a speculative narrative that I decided to combine with the visualization. I imagined a world where people are treated as *data subjects* or entities who's actions and subjective experiences can be quantified and determined. This can potentially undermine the very notion of art, as technologic advancements in brain-computer interfaces seem to be the perfect mean towards such an end.
