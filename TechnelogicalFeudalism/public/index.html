    <div class="about">
      <p><em>Technelogical Feudalism</em> is a experimentation that explores the ways class societies where controlled before the advent of modern manipulable infrastructures. The mode of control that is explored in this particular experimentation is religion. This peace does not critique religion as a system of believe, rather, the way it is applied in societies.</p>

      <p>During he Medieval Ages, which where notorious for various pandemics such such as the Black Death, humanity relied on religion as its biggest hope. Today we see how people rely on technology the same way religions where relied on during medieval ages. Technology could bring us increased life expectancy, an increase quality of life, and happiness - the same way religions where believe to. But when humanity relies on something, there is always room for exploitation, especially if that reliance is appealing to the masses.</p>

      <p>This experimentation divides the user into two groups, the <em>Noble</em>, and the <em>Peasant</em>. This is an experience that is intended for multiple users where some interact with the experimentation, and other users watch how they interact on the black canvas. The Noble is able to track the mouse portion and clicks. Multiple windows can be opened to simulate the interaction between multiple people.</p>

      <p>The peasant side is given an opportunity to accept religion and is given an semi-interactive environment. On the other side of the user, there is a person who looks at his actions. The very fact that he can monitor the actions of the Peasant, means that he is more manipulable. Religion here, is served as a form of entertainment that also translated into a form of surveilance and establishments of control.</p>
