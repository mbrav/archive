### Philosophic Meaning

According to the project’s philosophy, the world and everything that constitutes it relies on a constant process of rebirth and decay. Each moment is an experience of an individual mind-state such as a thought, a memory, a feeling or a perception. A mind-state arises, exists, and since it is impermanent, it soon ceases, following which the next mind-state arises. Thus the consciousness of a sentient being can be seen as a continuous series of birth and decay of these mind-states. Regardless, rebirth always remains the most persistent among these processes.

As the Pagoda flows through the seasons, it is aware that a day will come when it will no longer stand. Its existence will someday become annihilated, but only for a finite time. After its fall, the process of its rebirth will follow after…

The inspiration for this project was drawn from the movie called *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon* (2000) directed by a Chinese director Ang Lee who is well know being the director of *Life of Pi* (2012).
