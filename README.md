### Philosophic Meaning

According to this doctrine, the world and everything that constitutes it relies on a constant process of rebirth and decay. Each moment is an experience of an individual mind-state such as a thought, a memory, a feeling or a perception. A mind-state arises, exists and, being impermanent, ceases, following which the next mind-state arises. Thus the consciousness of a sentient being can be seen as a continuous series of birth and death of these mind-states. Rebirth is the persistence of this process.

As the Pagoda flows through the seasons, it is aware that a day will come when it will no longer stand. Its existence will someday become annihilated, but only for a finite time. After its fall, its rebirth process will follow soon afterâ€¦
