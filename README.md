## Narrative

### Chapter I: The Cosmic Present-Past
Whenever we take a glimpse at the night sky, most of us rarely realize that what we are looking at--is history. Whatever we see in the night sky, is a collection of photons that have traveled for thousands and millions of years from their point of origin. The photons coming from Alpha Centauri for example--our closest neighboring stellar system--is already 4.3 years old by the time it reaches our telescopes. When we look at the center of our galaxy, we see light that is 27,000 years old. When we observe Andromeda, our neighboring galaxy, we see light that is 2.5 million years old. Our night sky is filled with the cosmic past, and the gigabytes of data collected by our telescopes. This data has yet to be 'excavated' and reveal a cosmic secret lurking among the data. The sky, can be considered an opaque sediment through which the universe's timeline can be observed. Just by looking at the sky, we become archeologists--engaged in the excavation of the past.

### Chapter II: Primeval Ocean

Before the cosmos gained the ability to host any sense of history, it resembled a turbulent and chaotic ocean. Nothing made sense in the beginning and there was little space for history. But as time unfolded, structure started to prevail--out of what initially was meaningless and unstructured chaos.

These are a few artifacts that are part of human history which emerged out of their chaotic background.

### Chapter III: Creation of Meaning

As artifacts become introduced in human history, so is meaning. Objects are valued for their inner qualities and this is what makes history itself meaningful. Each historic artifact possesses its own inner world. It is therefore up to the excavators to choose which tools to use in order to excavate an artifact's past.

But are all tools able to reveal the meaningfulness of an artifact? Can excavation tools account all meaningfulness of its objects, or is there something that excavation tools omit?

Zoom into the artifacts using the MOUSE WHEEL to reveal their inner world.

### Chapter IV: Digitization

Today, digitization has become the current tool for excavating and revealing the past. By taking radio-telescope readings of the night sky, 3D scans of ancient Egyptian statues along with carbon dating techniques--humans engage in a excavation process that transforms every form of history, into a digitized past--a collection of data.

Data is the holy grail of ordering chaos and transforming it into order. If this is the current trend in archeology, then what does it do to the value of the artifacts?

### Chapter V: Anthropic Artifacts

When we take a look at archaeologic artifacts, how do we want to treat and consider them? Should we stop digitizing the past, and learn how to appreciate it as something that is beyond mere information, but that of eternal value, humanistic, and infinite? Should we return to worshiping Pharaohs like Ancient Egyptians did, or Egyptians did Zeus, or Romans did Jupiter? Could digitizing the past be the most logical and obvious thing to do?

### Chapter VI: The End

Take a moment to enjoy these digitized artifacts. Some of these would probably disintegrate after a few millions of years, but maybe their digital replica's would exist for longer.
