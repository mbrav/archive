His policy\n\nrecommendations follow his report.\n\n<span class=\"inlinemeta\">To:\t    Sid Blumenthal\n</span><span class=\"inlinemeta\">From: Scott Horton\n</span>\n\nDate: June 17, 2010\n\nSubj: Developments in Kyrgyzstan\n\n I was in Kyrgyzstan from June 1ï¿½ 6, during which time I met with almost all the members of the interim government,\n\nwith special focus on foreign relations, security and legal issues. Here are major points that emerged from my visit:\n\n      <span class=\"unclassified\">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776479 Date: 08/31/2015</span>\n\n1. Crisis in the South. Although I departed before the pogroms had commenced in Osh, I found that the interim\ngovernment fully expected violence to break out there but did not anticipate the inter-ethnic element. Several candidly\n\nacknowledged that the government's grip on the south, particularly Osh and Djalalabad provinces, was extremely\ntenuous. They said they had severe \"loyalty\" problems with key figures in the police and military. When I pressed on\n\nwhat they meant by \"loyalty,\" I was told that the Bakiyev family had \"its people\" in key positions in the police and army\nand that they had intercepted communications between Janysh Bakiyev and a number of key security officers in the\n\nsouth. \"Something is being planned to disrupt the referendum,\" I was told. Beknazarov told me he believed that,\nfollowing the pattern of the last two revolutions, they anticipated that there would be an attack on administrative\n\noffices in the south, following quickly within a few days by attacks in Bishkek. Government leaders I spoke with over the\nweekend told me they now recognize they had misassessed the data they had, that the Bakiyev plan was obviously to\n\ninstigate inter-ethnic violence.\n\nPrecisely what led to the tragedy in and around Osh is still unclear and requires careful investigation, but people I have\nspoken with in Osh describe police and army leaders directing the pogroms, and they were able to identify some of\n\nthese individuals as persons close to the Bakiyevs. Moreover, the timing and some of the specific descriptions of events\nsupport this thesisï¿½Bakiyev was the only person who clearly had something to gain from the violence. If that is so, then\n\nBakiyev adopted an extremely cynical, indeed criminal strategy. His objectives would have been to derail the\nreferendum, demonstrate the weakness of the interim government, and fuel calls for an iron-fisted central government\n\nthrough the resurrection of his presidency. The tactics used bear comparison with those used by Slobodan Milosevic\nand Radovan Kara&'id as Yugoslavia disintegrated or by the Soviet MVD in the waning days of the Soviet empire in\n\nprograms like \"Operation Koltso.\" If the government's charges bear out, serious crimes were committed by the Bakiyev\nfaction.\n\nWhile Otunbayeva publicly states that order has been restored in the south and that foreign intervention is no longer\n\nneeded, I am not persuaded that this is what she actually thinks. She is anxious to build public confidence in her\ngovernment and its abilities. Confidentially she acknowledges that the interim government's grip over the situation in\n\nthe south is extremely weak and that the government does not feel it can necessarily count on the local police and\nmilitary there, whose loyalties are plainly divided. This in turn suggests that the international community should give\n\nactive consideration to both the humanitarian and the security dimensions of the situation in the south. My sense\nremains that Otunbayeva would strongly welcome such an initiative.\n\n2.  Internal Workings of the Interim Government. The interim government verges on being completely dysfunctional. It\n\noperates as a collection of individual fiefdoms, with leaders engaged in constant squabbles over patronage\nappointments. Career civil service personnel report being terrorized and extorted. I spent the better part of three days\n\n inside the current government headquarters on Staraya Ploshchod and was able to directly observe primitive horse-\ntrading, threats and counterthreats between key government functionaries, sometimes in agitated voices. Roza\n\nOtunbayeva and a handful of figures closest to her were exceptions in this processï¿½admonishing others about the\n unseemliness of their conduct, urging moderation and restraint. But Otunbayeva also acknowledges that the limitations\n\non her own authority and states that she \"has to put up with it,\" at least for the moment. Three government members\n advised me during meetings of their intention to resign before the end of the month in order to start running for\n\n parliament. Significantly, I sense sharp rifts within the governmentï¿½between Atembayev and Beknazarov, for instance,\n who could not refrain from criticizing one another in my interviews with them, or between Sariyev and Beknazarov.\n\n Only Otunbayeva (and to a lesser extent her close ally Elmira Ibraimova) appear to be the glue that holds things\n\n together, commanding the respect of the other government members. I found that the admiration for Otunbayeva was\n almost universalï¿½she appears to be the only figure in the government emerging from the interim period with an\n\n untarnished reputation. Still the special order under which she has assumed power as \"president of the interim\n government\" presents some clear problems for her authority. She has a fixed term into 2011, but she will have no\n\n democratic mandate. After the new government is formed, based on the parliamentary elections, they will have\n democratic legitimacy and she will notï¿½this sets up a situation in which her authority may well be eclipsed or at least\n\n made more narrow. Still, all the members of the current government recognize that she has essential skills that they do\n notï¿½particularly her ability to conciliate and her ability to reach out to other leaders on the international stage.\n\n     <span class=\"unclassified\">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776479 Date: 08/31/2015</span>\n\nThere is an expectation that the parliamentary elections will result in a weeding out of the government. The next\n\ngovernment is expected to be formed through a parliamentary coalition. But only two or perhaps three of the current\nseven factions will survive. Much of the bickering and instability in the current government is keyed to the coming game\n\nof parliamentary moving chairsï¿½there is an intense struggle now to secure personal loyalty and funds to use in the\nparliamentary elections; the entire process has an aura of sink or swim about it. Ironically the immediate prospect of\n\nparliamentary elections and the sense that they will be genuinely open and fair thus contributes to the ineptness and\nnear chaotic appearance of the current government.\n\n3. Constitution and Referendum. Under the guidance of Tekebayev, the government put forward a proposed new\n\nconstitution, which it seeks to have confirmed through a referendum vote on June 27. The constitution itself does shift\nthe country further in the direction of a parliamentary democracy, and it contains unusual protection for parliamentary\n\nminority factions. Government leaders told me that Kazakh president Nursultan Nazarbayev had waded in on the\nquestion of the constitution directly, pressing them to retain a \"strong president\" system. They say this was coupled\n\nwith not-very-subtle threats, and that the frontier between Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan remains closed, with harmful\nconsequences for the Kyrgyz economy. A major question exists about holding the referendum as scheduled. The events\n\nin the south have resulted in the mass displacement of population and if held as planned, a large part of the population\nin the south would probably be disenfranchised. However, government leaders say that their current problems all come\n\nback to legitimacy, and they will not be able to form a government with democratic legitimacy without a new\nconstitution and new elections. Accordingly, they resist any further delays and are even contemplating moving the date\n\nof the parliamentary election forward to the last week of August (it is now set for October 10). The crisis in the south\npresents a severe dilemma in this regards, and it seems that this would have been Bakiyev's objective in instigating it, if\n\nindeed he did.\n\n4. Manas Transit Center. As expected, I discovered that the interim government is deeply fragmented on the question\nof MTC. One faction headed by Otunbayeva favors a \"pragmatic solution\" to the base issue under which it will be\n\ncontinued but placed on a more transparent basis in which the economic benefits to the government are clear.\nOtunbayeva argues that the base can only be accepted under circumstances in which it presents no friction for Kyrgyz-\n\nRussian relations; she seeks to have disputes surrounding fuel supply, for instance, resolved directly between the United\nStates and Russia. Another faction, headed by Beknazarov, takes a more demagogic approach, denouncing the base and\n\nseeking its closing in internal meetings. Talking with Beknazarov, I had the clear impression that his attitudes were\nentirely opportunisticï¿½he thinks this will be a good campaign issue to use on the hustings. He suggested rather strongly\n\nthat he could accept a continued base presence under the right circumstances and that he views threats to close the\nbase as a sort of stick to use to extort more money and other concessions from the Americans. In general, Beknazarov\n\nstrikes me as hot-headed and crass and an untrustworthy partner in any future discussions. Atembayev also has\nsomewhat demagogic impulses, though they are mild by comparison. Otunbayeva, the third and most senior member\nof the government engaged on base issues, is the critical voice of reason in the process. My impression based on\n\ndiscussions with numerous figures is that Otunbayeva's views currently hold sway. However, all the government\n members are agreed that the economic deal struck by Bakiyev is unfavorable to the Kyrgyz state and that the base must\n\n rest on transparent economic concessions and there can be no more under-the-table dealings with political figures.\n\n 5. Resolving the Crisis in the South. I believe that two key points should be kept in mind when approaching the\n\n humanitarian crisis that has emerged in the south. First, the crisis probably has its origins in a raw struggle for power.\nThe interim government's legitimacy deficit contributed to the problem, because it left the government with weak tools\n to control the situation in the south. A long-term solution to the problem must involve the creation of governments at\n\n the national (Bishkek) and regional (Osh, Djalalabad) levels that have an essential modicum of democratic legitimacy.\n Delaying this process may only hasten the entire country's continued descent into chaos. This highlights the need to\n\n conduct free, fair and open elections as quickly as possible. Second, the last thing the interim government needs is a\n \"Sophie's choice\" between the United States and Russian Federation. International assistance needs to reflect a joint\n\n U.S.-Russian approach and showcase U.S. and Russian leadership (not merely participation). With President Medvedev's\n visit to the White House now on the horizon, this would be a good opportunity to establish joint sponsorship of an\n\n international humanitarian initiative. Here, I believe, are the essential elements of a program that could achieve U.S.-\n\n Russian co-sponsorship:\n\n       <span class=\"unclassified\">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776479 Date: 08/31/2015</span>\n\nï¿½       An Appeal for Restraint: Although the instigation of the conflict appears clearly to rest with ethnic Kyrgyz\n\nagitators, including a number in uniform and operating military equipment, at present both Uzbek and Kyrgyz armed\ngroups are involved in random shootings designed to reinforce perceptions of their group being persecuted (rapes etc.)\n\nby another. Credible reports are suggesting that there has been political manipulation (including payment of money to\ndrug and other criminal gangs) aimed at fomenting violence. The attack on a sports facility set up by a prominent Uzbek\ndrug baron (murdered several years earlier) in Osh shortly before the violence started also suggests that criminal gangs\n\ninvolved in drug transshipment had another motivation for engaging in the violence. It may be that the violence was an\ninitiative of the deposed president, but once it began, it provided cover for numerous incidents of score-settling and\ncriminal mischief. In these circumstances, a strong appeal for restraint is appropriate and martial law rules including\n\ncurfews may legitimately be imposed by the interim government. An imprimatur of support from the international\ncommunity would help establish the authority of the interim government in this process.\n\nï¿½       Exit Corridors for Civilians: Civilians who feel threatened must be allowed to leave the high risk zones, and access\nof humanitarian aid, and creation of a safe zone for humanitarian operation should be priorities at locations created to\n\nshelter them. The EU, OSCE and UN issued a statement on June 16 calling for a humanitarian corridor in the southern\nregions of Osh and Jalalabad provinces, as well as of ensuring the equitable distribution of humanitarian aid among\nthose in need. The cooperation of the Uzbek government may be particularly important in this process.\n\nï¿½       Peacekeeping/Policing Operation: The international community should support special arrangements with broad\ninternational legitimacy and participation to enhance peacekeeping and police operations in the affected area. As I\n\nnoted, even though Otunbayeva made a public statement on June 15 to the effect that foreign military/police\nintervention was no longer needed, the situation remains precarious and in her confidential discussions Otunbayeva\nacknowledges the benefits in confidence building that would emerge from an qualified, professional and international\n\npresence in the region. Peacekeeping/policing operations should at a minimum include security for designated\nsheltering areas for refugees and internally displaced persons and monitoring operations in tandem with local police and\nmilitary, to build confidence in their protective functions.\n\nï¿½       Investigation of Events: a broad, credible, independent investigation should be undertaken into the events and\ntheir origin. The investigation should be under the aegis of an international organization, such as the Security Council or\n\nOSCE and it should be conducted by an individual of stature with strong credentials as a fact-finder and prosecutor. The\ninvestigation should particularly take cognizance of accusations that crimes against humanity were perpetrated,\npotentially including crimes of genocide. The involvement of persons exercising ostensible government authorityï¿½\n\n policemen, military figures, leaders of the civil administrationï¿½should be given special scrutiny in this process. The\nperson commissioned to handle the investigation should be specifically empowered to recommend criminal charges be\n brought against individuals identified in his investigationï¿½either by the criminal authorities of the Kyrgyz Republic or\n\n before an international body seized of proper jurisdiction.\n\n ï¿½      Effective Post-Conflict Reconstruction. UN authorities are estimating that as many as 450,000 persons may have\n\n been displaced by the current violence. The devastation in central Osh and in numerous villages is reported to be near\n total. There will be an intense housing shortage and a crisis with respect to food supply and healthcare. The\n international community under United States and Russian leadership should provide generous support to jumpstart the\n\n reconstruction process, prioritizing its assistance to benefit those most egregiously injured by the violence.\n\n ï¿½      The Referendum/Parliamentary Elections. In view of the disruption and violence, the interim government may\n\n well conclude that the constitutional referendum must be postponed. However, if it does not postpone the referendum,\n then extraordinary measures should be taken to insure that internally displaced persons and refugees are given an\n opportunity to voteï¿½in both cases this will be a reemphasis of the bond of citizenship and a promise of inclusion in the\n\n democratic process that will be critical to the resolution of the crisis. The international community should also mobilize\n observers in connection with the parliamentary elections to help assure that candidates have fair access to the ballot\n and to media, that campaigns are permitted to proceed without unreasonable limitations and that voting occurs in a fair\n\n and free manner across the country. Special attention in this process should be given to the affected areas to insure\n that refugees and IDPs have a fair opportunity to vote and are freed from unreasonable limitations in the process.\n\t\t\t\t</div></div>",

Here are major points that emerged from my visit:\n\n      UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776479 Date: 08/31/2015\n\n1. Crisis in the South. Although I departed before the pogroms had commenced in Osh, I found that the interim\ngovernment fully expected violence to break out there but did not anticipate the inter-ethnic element. Several candidly\n\nacknowledged that the government's grip on the south, particularly Osh and Djalalabad provinces, was extremely\ntenuous. They said they had severe \"loyalty\" problems with key figures in the police and military. When I pressed on\n\nwhat they meant by \"loyalty,\" I was told that the Bakiyev family had \"its people\" in key positions in the police and army\nand that they had intercepted communications between Janysh Bakiyev and a number of key security officers in the\n\nsouth. \"Something is being planned to disrupt the referendum,\" I was told. Beknazarov told me he believed that,\nfollowing the pattern of the last two revolutions, they anticipated that there would be an attack on administrative\n\noffices in the south, following quickly within a few days by attacks in Bishkek. Government leaders I spoke with over the\nweekend told me they now recognize they had misassessed the data they had, that the Bakiyev plan was obviously to\n\ninstigate inter-ethnic violence.\n\nPrecisely what led to the tragedy in and around Osh is still unclear and requires careful investigation, but people I have\nspoken with in Osh describe police and army leaders directing the pogroms, and they were able to identify some of\n\nthese individuals as persons close to the Bakiyevs. Moreover, the timing and some of the specific descriptions of events\nsupport this thesisï¿½Bakiyev was the only person who clearly had something to gain from the violence. If that is so, then\n\nBakiyev adopted an extremely cynical, indeed criminal strategy. His objectives would have been to derail the\nreferendum, demonstrate the weakness of the interim government, and fuel calls for an iron-fisted central government\n\nthrough the resurrection of his presidency. The tactics used bear comparison with those used by Slobodan Milosevic\nand Radovan Kara&'id as Yugoslavia disintegrated or by the Soviet MVD in the waning days of the Soviet empire in\n\nprograms like \"Operation Koltso.\" If the government's charges bear out, serious crimes were committed by the Bakiyev\nfaction.\n\nWhile Otunbayeva publicly states that order has been restored in the south and that foreign intervention is no longer\n\nneeded, I am not persuaded that this is what she actually thinks. She is anxious to build public confidence in her\ngovernment and its abilities. Confidentially she acknowledges that the interim government's grip over the situation in\n\nthe south is extremely weak and that the government does not feel it can necessarily count on the local police and\nmilitary there, whose loyalties are plainly divided. This in turn suggests that the international community should give\n\nactive consideration to both the humanitarian and the security dimensions of the situation in the south. My sense\nremains that Otunbayeva would strongly welcome such an initiative.\n\n2.  Internal Workings of the Interim Government. The interim government verges on being completely dysfunctional. It\n\noperates as a collection of individual fiefdoms, with leaders engaged in constant squabbles over patronage\nappointments. Career civil service personnel report being terrorized and extorted. I spent the better part of three days\n\n inside the current government headquarters on Staraya Ploshchod and was able to directly observe primitive horse-\ntrading, threats and counterthreats between key government functionaries, sometimes in agitated voices. Roza\n\nOtunbayeva and a handful of figures closest to her were exceptions in this processï¿½admonishing others about the\n unseemliness of their conduct, urging moderation and restraint. But Otunbayeva also acknowledges that the limitations\n\non her own authority and states that she \"has to put up with it,\" at least for the moment. Three government members\n advised me during meetings of their intention to resign before the end of the month in order to start running for\n\n parliament. Significantly, I sense sharp rifts within the governmentï¿½between Atembayev and Beknazarov, for instance,\n who could not refrain from criticizing one another in my interviews with them, or between Sariyev and Beknazarov.\n\n Only Otunbayeva (and to a lesser extent her close ally Elmira Ibraimova) appear to be the glue that holds things\n\n together, commanding the respect of the other government members. I found that the admiration for Otunbayeva was\n almost universalï¿½she appears to be the only figure in the government emerging from the interim period with an\n\n untarnished reputation. Still the special order under which she has assumed power as \"president of the interim\n government\" presents some clear problems for her authority. She has a fixed term into 2011, but she will have no\n\n democratic mandate. After the new government is formed, based on the parliamentary elections, they will have\n democratic legitimacy and she will notï¿½this sets up a situation in which her authority may well be eclipsed or at least\n\n made more narrow. Still, all the members of the current government recognize that she has essential skills that they do\n notï¿½particularly her ability to conciliate and her ability to reach out to other leaders on the international stage.\n\n     UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776479 Date: 08/31/2015\n\nThere is an expectation that the parliamentary elections will result in a weeding out of the government. The next\n\ngovernment is expected to be formed through a parliamentary coalition. But only two or perhaps three of the current\nseven factions will survive. Much of the bickering and instability in the current government is keyed to the coming game\n\nof parliamentary moving chairsï¿½there is an intense struggle now to secure personal loyalty and funds to use in the\nparliamentary elections; the entire process has an aura of sink or swim about it. Ironically the immediate prospect of\n\nparliamentary elections and the sense that they will be genuinely open and fair thus contributes to the ineptness and\nnear chaotic appearance of the current government.\n\n3. Constitution and Referendum. Under the guidance of Tekebayev, the government put forward a proposed new\n\nconstitution, which it seeks to have confirmed through a referendum vote on June 27. The constitution itself does shift\nthe country further in the direction of a parliamentary democracy, and it contains unusual protection for parliamentary\n\nminority factions. Government leaders told me that Kazakh president Nursultan Nazarbayev had waded in on the\nquestion of the constitution directly, pressing them to retain a \"strong president\" system. They say this was coupled\n\nwith not-very-subtle threats, and that the frontier between Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan remains closed, with harmful\nconsequences for the Kyrgyz economy. A major question exists about holding the referendum as scheduled. The events\n\nin the south have resulted in the mass displacement of population and if held as planned, a large part of the population\nin the south would probably be disenfranchised. However, government leaders say that their current problems all come\n\nback to legitimacy, and they will not be able to form a government with democratic legitimacy without a new\nconstitution and new elections. Accordingly, they resist any further delays and are even contemplating moving the date\n\nof the parliamentary election forward to the last week of August (it is now set for October 10). The crisis in the south\npresents a severe dilemma in this regards, and it seems that this would have been Bakiyev's objective in instigating it, if\n\nindeed he did.\n\n4. Manas Transit Center. As expected, I discovered that the interim government is deeply fragmented on the question\nof MTC. One faction headed by Otunbayeva favors a \"pragmatic solution\" to the base issue under which it will be\n\ncontinued but placed on a more transparent basis in which the economic benefits to the government are clear.\nOtunbayeva argues that the base can only be accepted under circumstances in which it presents no friction for Kyrgyz-\n\nRussian relations; she seeks to have disputes surrounding fuel supply, for instance, resolved directly between the United\nStates and Russia. Another faction, headed by Beknazarov, takes a more demagogic approach, denouncing the base and\n\nseeking its closing in internal meetings. Talking with Beknazarov, I had the clear impression that his attitudes were\nentirely opportunisticï¿½he thinks this will be a good campaign issue to use on the hustings. He suggested rather strongly\n\nthat he could accept a continued base presence under the right circumstances and that he views threats to close the\nbase as a sort of stick to use to extort more money and other concessions from the Americans. In general, Beknazarov\n\nstrikes me as hot-headed and crass and an untrustworthy partner in any future discussions. Atembayev also has\nsomewhat demagogic impulses, though they are mild by comparison. Otunbayeva, the third and most senior member\nof the government engaged on base issues, is the critical voice of reason in the process. My impression based on\n\ndiscussions with numerous figures is that Otunbayeva's views currently hold sway. However, all the government\n members are agreed that the economic deal struck by Bakiyev is unfavorable to the Kyrgyz state and that the base must\n\n rest on transparent economic concessions and there can be no more under-the-table dealings with political figures.\n\n 5. Resolving the Crisis in the South. I believe that two key points should be kept in mind when approaching the\n\n humanitarian crisis that has emerged in the south. First, the crisis probably has its origins in a raw struggle for power.\nThe interim government's legitimacy deficit contributed to the problem, because it left the government with weak tools\n to control the situation in the south. A long-term solution to the problem must involve the creation of governments at\n\n the national (Bishkek) and regional (Osh, Djalalabad) levels that have an essential modicum of democratic legitimacy.\n Delaying this process may only hasten the entire country's continued descent into chaos. This highlights the need to\n\n conduct free, fair and open elections as quickly as possible. Second, the last thing the interim government needs is a\n \"Sophie's choice\" between the United States and Russian Federation. International assistance needs to reflect a joint\n\n U.S.-Russian approach and showcase U.S. and Russian leadership (not merely participation). With President Medvedev's\n visit to the White House now on the horizon, this would be a good opportunity to establish joint sponsorship of an\n\n international humanitarian initiative. Here, I believe, are the essential elements of a program that could achieve U.S.-\n\n Russian co-sponsorship:\n\n       UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776479 Date: 08/31/2015\n\nï¿½       An Appeal for Restraint: Although the instigation of the conflict appears clearly to rest with ethnic Kyrgyz\n\nagitators, including a number in uniform and operating military equipment, at present both Uzbek and Kyrgyz armed\ngroups are involved in random shootings designed to reinforce perceptions of their group being persecuted (rapes etc.)\n\nby another. Credible reports are suggesting that there has been political manipulation (including payment of money to\ndrug and other criminal gangs) aimed at fomenting violence. The attack on a sports facility set up by a prominent Uzbek\ndrug baron (murdered several years earlier) in Osh shortly before the violence started also suggests that criminal gangs\n\ninvolved in drug transshipment had another motivation for engaging in the violence. It may be that the violence was an\ninitiative of the deposed president, but once it began, it provided cover for numerous incidents of score-settling and\ncriminal mischief. In these circumstances, a strong appeal for restraint is appropriate and martial law rules including\n\ncurfews may legitimately be imposed by the interim government. An imprimatur of support from the international\ncommunity would help establish the authority of the interim government in this process.\n\nï¿½       Exit Corridors for Civilians: Civilians who feel threatened must be allowed to leave the high risk zones, and access\nof humanitarian aid, and creation of a safe zone for humanitarian operation should be priorities at locations created to\n\nshelter them. The EU, OSCE and UN issued a statement on June 16 calling for a humanitarian corridor in the southern\nregions of Osh and Jalalabad provinces, as well as of ensuring the equitable distribution of humanitarian aid among\nthose in need. The cooperation of the Uzbek government may be particularly important in this process.\n\nï¿½       Peacekeeping/Policing Operation: The international community should support special arrangements with broad\ninternational legitimacy and participation to enhance peacekeeping and police operations in the affected area. As I\n\nnoted, even though Otunbayeva made a public statement on June 15 to the effect that foreign military/police\nintervention was no longer needed, the situation remains precarious and in her confidential discussions Otunbayeva\nacknowledges the benefits in confidence building that would emerge from an qualified, professional and international\n\npresence in the region. Peacekeeping/policing operations should at a minimum include security for designated\nsheltering areas for refugees and internally displaced persons and monitoring operations in tandem with local police and\nmilitary, to build confidence in their protective functions.\n\nï¿½       Investigation of Events: a broad, credible, independent investigation should be undertaken into the events and\ntheir origin. The investigation should be under the aegis of an international organization, such as the Security Council or\n\nOSCE and it should be conducted by an individual of stature with strong credentials as a fact-finder and prosecutor. The\ninvestigation should particularly take cognizance of accusations that crimes against humanity were perpetrated,\npotentially including crimes of genocide. The involvement of persons exercising ostensible government authorityï¿½\n\n policemen, military figures, leaders of the civil administrationï¿½should be given special scrutiny in this process. The\nperson commissioned to handle the investigation should be specifically empowered to recommend criminal charges be\n brought against individuals identified in his investigationï¿½either by the criminal authorities of the Kyrgyz Republic or\n\n before an international body seized of proper jurisdiction.\n\n ï¿½      Effective Post-Conflict Reconstruction. UN authorities are estimating that as many as 450,000 persons may have\n\n been displaced by the current violence. The devastation in central Osh and in numerous villages is reported to be near\n total. There will be an intense housing shortage and a crisis with respect to food supply and healthcare. The\n international community under United States and Russian leadership should provide generous support to jumpstart the\n\n reconstruction process, prioritizing its assistance to benefit those most egregiously injured by the violence.\n\n ï¿½      The Referendum/Parliamentary Elections. In view of the disruption and violence, the interim government may\n\n well conclude that the constitutional referendum must be postponed. However, if it does not postpone the referendum,\n then extraordinary measures should be taken to insure that internally displaced persons and refugees are given an\n opportunity to voteï¿½in both cases this will be a reemphasis of the bond of citizenship and a promise of inclusion in the\n\n democratic process that will be critical to the resolution of the crisis. The international community should also mobilize\n observers in connection with the parliamentary elections to help assure that candidates have fair access to the ballot\n and to media, that campaigns are permitted to proceed without unreasonable limitations and that voting occurs in a fair\n\n and free manner across the country. Special attention in this process should be given to the affected areas to insure\n that refugees and IDPs have a fair opportunity to vote and are freed from unreasonable limitations in the process.\n\t\t\t\t"

It's wrong, wrong, wrong!\nJoseph Stiglitz, the Nobel prizewinner who predicted the global crisis, delivers his verdict on the Chancellor's first Budget\n\nand tells Paul Vallely it will take the UK deeper into recession and hit millions ï¿½ the poorest ï¿½ badly Sunday, 27 June 2010\nGeorge Osborne will probably not be very bothered that there is a man who thinks he got last week's emergency Budget\n\nalmost entirely wrong. But he should be. Because that man is a former chief economist at the World Bank who won the\nNobel Prize for Economics for his work on why markets do not produce the outcomes which, in theory, they ought to.\n\nProfessor Joseph Stiglitz, who has been described as the biggest brain in economics, is distinctly unimpressed by George\nOsborne's strategy. This, he predicts, will make Britain's recovery from recession longer, slower and harder than it needs\n\nto be. The rise in VAT could even tip us into a double-dip recession.\nStiglitz, who was once Bill Clinton's senior economic adviser, is now professor of economics and finance at Columbia\n\nBusiness School. He was in the UK this week at the University of Manchester, where he chairs the Brooks World Poverty\nInstitute, but he lifted his head from the detail of international development to scrutinise the economic strategy of the\n\nConservative Chancellor whose Liberal Democrat partners recently reversed their judgement that massive public\nspending cuts now would endanger the economy and joined in the Tory slash-and-burn strategy. They were deeply\n\nwrong to do so, he believes.\n It would be a mistake to ignore Stiglitz on this. He has a track record of getting his predictions right. He was one of the\n\nfew economists who predicted the global financial meltdown long before it occurred.\n\"What happened was very much in accord with what I expected,\" he tells me when we meet for a coffee outside the\n\n Blackwell bookshop in the centre of the university. \"The data was pretty clear about that.\" And the scale of the crash?\n \"That wasn't a surprise,\" he adds, in a matter-of-fact manner. \"The bigger the bubble, the bigger the burst.\n\n \"The thing most economists did not fully grasp was the extent to which the banks engaged in murky risk-taking activities.\n They were taking a risk with our money, their shareholders' money, the bond-holders' money,\" he says. Banks were\n\n demanding up to 40 per cent of the corporate profits, saying their innovative financing was adding value. But \"all this\n talk about innovation was a sham\" because it did not relate to any real increase in the economy's productivity, he says.\n\n \"There was a prima facie case of something screwy going on [with all the] perverse incentives that would lead them to\n take excessive risk. But there was no way anyone could know or believe that the banks were [conducting themselves] at\n\n that level of stupidity. I predicted that there was going to be a collapse because of the information asymmetry problems\n that were being created.\" His Nobel prize was given for exactly that ï¿½ showing how markets fail because different people\n\n in them hold different levels of information.\n Yet there is no hint of I-told-you-so about Stiglitz's tone as he asks the waiter for coffee. He orders decaffeinated, but\n\n suggests the British economy needs the opposite: a stiff stimulant rather than the \"fiscal consolidation\" which is George\n Osborne's economic euphemism for cuts.\n\n Fiscal stimulus is out of fashion now. World leaders embarked on that strategy ï¿½ injecting money to re-energise the\n economy ï¿½ after the banking crash three years ago. It was widely perceived not to have worked because the money\n\n governments pumped into the banks was not passed on to ailing businesses or individuals in trouble with their\n mortgages.\n\n \"The problem was that, in the US, the stimulus wasn't big enough,\" he says. \"Too much of it was in tax cuts. And when\n they gave money to the banks they gave it to the wrong banks and, as a result, credit has not been restored ï¿½ we can\n\n expect a couple of million or more homes to be repossessed this year than last year ï¿½ and the economy has not been\n\n       <span class=\"unclassified\">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05777221 Date: 08/31/2015</span>\n\nrestarted.\" Instead of producing a consensus that the government should have done more, it has created disillusion that\n\nthe government can do anything, Stiglitz says.\nThe result is that, following the attacks by the financial markets on Greece and then Spain, everybody is now in a mood\n\nof retrenchment. \"It's not just pre-Keynesian, it's Hooverite,\" he says. By which he means governments are not just\n\nrefusing to stimulate, they are making cuts, as Herbert Hoover did in the US in 1929 ï¿½ when he turned the Wall Street\nCrash into the Great Depression. \"Hoover had this idea that, whenever you go into recession, deficits grow, so he\n\ndecided to go for cuts ï¿½ which is what the foolish financial markets that got us into this trouble in the first place now\nwant.\"\n\nIt has become the new received wisdom throughout Europe. But it is the classic error made by those who confuse a\nhousehold's economics with those of a national economy.\n\n\"If you have a household that can't pay its debts, you tell it to cut back on spending to free up the cash to pay the debts.\nBut in a national economy, if you cut back on your spending, then economic activity goes down, nobody invests, the\n\namount of tax you take goes down, the amount you pay out in unemployment benefits goes up ï¿½ and you don't have\nenough money to pay your debts.\n\n\"The old story is still true: you cut expenditures and the economy goes down. We have lots of experiments which show\nthis, thanks to Herbert Hoover and the IMF,\" he adds. The IMF imposed that mistaken policy in Korea, Thailand,\n\nIndonesia, Argentina and hosts of other developing countries in the 1980s and 1990s. \"So we know what will happen:\neconomies will get weaker, investment will get stymied and it's a downward vicious spiral. How far down we don't know\n\nï¿½ it could be a Japanese malaise. Japan did an experiment just like this in 1997; just as it was recovering, it raised VAT\nand went into another recession.\"\n\nThen why have we not learned from all that? Because politicians like George Osborne are driven by ideology; the\nnational deficit is an excuse to shrink the state because that is what he wanted anyway. Because the financial market\n\nonly cares about one thing ï¿½ getting repaid. And because other European governments are panicking because of the\nmarket's wild attack on Greece and Spain, and they don't want to be next.\n\n\"But cutbacks in Germany, Britain and France will mean all of Europe will suffer. The cuts will all feed back negatively.\nAnd if everyone follows this policy, their budget deficits will get worse, so they will have to make more cuts and raise\n\ntaxes more. It's a vicious downward spiral. We're now looking at a long, hard, slow recovery with the possibility of a\ndouble dip if everybody cuts back at the same time. The best scenario is long and hard ... and the worst is much worse. If\n\nany one of these countries is forced into default, the banking system is so highly leveraged that it could cause real\nproblems. This is really risky, really scary.\"\n\nSo what should we be doing? \"The lesson is not that you cut back spending, but that you redirect it. You cut out the war\nin Afghanistan. You cut a couple of hundred billion dollars of wasteful military expenditure. You cut out oil subsidies.\n\nThere's a long list of things we can cut. But you increase spending in other areas, such as research and development,\ninfrastructure, education\" ï¿½ areas where government can get a good return on the investment of public money. \"I\n\nhaven't done the calculation for Britain, but, for the US, all you need is a return on government investment of 5 to 6 per\ncent and the long-term deficit debt is lowered.\"\n\nTaxes also need to be restructured. Osborne has increased capital gains tax for high earners from 18 to 28 per cent.\n\"There's absolutely no reason why you couldn't tax speculative gains [from rising house or land prices] by 40 per cent.\n\nThere's no social return on it and land is going to be there whether people have speculated or not. But you lower the tax\non investment in things like R&D.\"\n\nStiglitz has one more practical solution to offer. Governments should set up their own banks to restart lending to\n businesses and save struggling homeowners from repossession. \"If the banks aren't lending, let's create a new lending\n\nfacility to do that job,\" he says. \"In the US, we gave $700bn to the banks; if we had used a fraction of that to create a\n new bank, we could have financed all the lending that was needed.\"\n\n Indeed, it could be done for far less. \"Take $100bn, lever that at 10 to 1 [by attracting funds from the private sector] and\nthat's a trillion-dollar new lending capacity ï¿½ more than the real economy needs.\"\n\nSuch a move would help ordinary people more than all Osborne's rhetoric about being tough but fair. Stiglitz is sceptical,\n too, about the moral underpinning of a Budget which claims that \"we are all in this together\", but then hits the poorest\n\n hardest.\n Analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies has suggested that the Chancellor's Budget will cost the poor 2.5 per cent of\n\n their income, while the rich will lose just 1 per cent. \"I've not made an independent study on that point, but cuts in\n public services will have a disproportionate effect on the poor,\" Stiglitz says. Osborne's Budget \"may be well-\n\n       <span class=\"unclassified\">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05777221 Date: 08/31/2015</span>\n\nintentioned, but it takes an enormous amount of work to make sure that a package of public spending cuts of that\n\nmagnitude doesn't hit the poor disproportionately\".\nHis big fear is that overseas aid, which has been protected in this first round of cuts, will not escape a second.\n\n\"Developing countries have redirected themselves towards Asia, and China in particular, in recent years, so growth in\nAfrica will be more robust than one might have expected, given the severity of the downturn,\" he says.\n\nEven so, aid remains vital to poor countries. \"If aid is cut back, growth will be badly affected,\" he says. \"China is\nproviding aid, but its aid is all in infrastructure, whereas aid from the US and Europe is mainly in education and health -\n\nareas in which ordinary people will suffer most if there are cuts.\"\n\nJoseph Stiglitz has come full circle. What the world needs now ï¿½ developing and developed ï¿½ is not retrenchment but\ngreater economic stimulus. It is not a message many are in the mood to hear. But they didn't listen to him last time,\n\neither. And he turned out to be right, and they were wrong ï¿½ and at what a cost to us all.\n\t\t\t\t</div></div>",

Governments should set up their own banks to restart lending to\n businesses and save struggling homeowners from repossession. \"If the banks aren't lending, let's create a new lending\n\nfacility to do that job,\" he says. \"In the US, we gave $700bn to the banks; if we had used a fraction of that to create a\n new bank, we could have financed all the lending that was needed.\"\n\n Indeed, it could be done for far less. \"Take $100bn, lever that at 10 to 1 [by attracting funds from the private sector] and\nthat's a trillion-dollar new lending capacity ï¿½ more than the real economy needs.\"\n\nSuch a move would help ordinary people more than all Osborne's rhetoric about being tough but fair. Stiglitz is sceptical,\n too, about the moral underpinning of a Budget which claims that \"we are all in this together\", but then hits the poorest\n\n hardest.\n Analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies has suggested that the Chancellor's Budget will cost the poor 2.5 per cent of\n\n their income, while the rich will lose just 1 per cent. \"I've not made an independent study on that point, but cuts in\n public services will have a disproportionate effect on the poor,\" Stiglitz says. Osborne's Budget \"may be well-\n\n       UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05777221 Date: 08/31/2015\n\nintentioned, but it takes an enormous amount of work to make sure that a package of public spending cuts of that\n\nmagnitude doesn't hit the poor disproportionately\".\nHis big fear is that overseas aid, which has been protected in this first round of cuts, will not escape a second.\n\n\"Developing countries have redirected themselves towards Asia, and China in particular, in recent years, so growth in\nAfrica will be more robust than one might have expected, given the severity of the downturn,\" he says.\n\nEven so, aid remains vital to poor countries. \"If aid is cut back, growth will be badly affected,\" he says. \"China is\nproviding aid, but its aid is all in infrastructure, whereas aid from the US and Europe is mainly in education and health -\n\nareas in which ordinary people will suffer most if there are cuts.\"\n\nJoseph Stiglitz has come full circle. What the world needs now ï¿½ developing and developed ï¿½ is not retrenchment but\ngreater economic stimulus. It is not a message many are in the mood to hear. But they didn't listen to him last time,\n\neither. And he turned out to be right, and they were wrong ï¿½ and at what a cost to us all.\n\t\t\t\t"

The Quartet\n\nreiterates its call for a solution that addresses Israel's legitimate security concerns, including an end to weapons\nsmuggling into Gaza; promotes Palestinian unity based on the Palestine Liberation Organization commitments and the\n\nreunification of Gaza and the West Bank under the legitimate Palestinian Authority; and ensures the unimpeded flow of\nhumanitarian aid, commercial goods and persons to and from Gaza, consistent with United Nations Security Council\n\nresolution 1860 (2009). The Quartet declares its readiness to work closely with Israel, the Palestinian Government and\ninternational donors in order to achieve sustainable economic development on the basis of the full implementation of\n\nthe Agreement on Access and Movement of 2005 and in the broader perspective of the two-state solution.\n\nConsistent with these objectives, the Quartet and the Quartet Representative have worked with Israel, as well as\nconsulting the Palestinian Authority, Egypt, and other concerned parties, to effect a fundamental change in policy in\n\nGaza. The new policy towards Gaza just announced by the Government of Israel is a welcome development. The Quartet\n notes that the elaboration of further details and modalities of implementation will be important in ensuring the\n\neffectiveness of the new policy. Full and effective implementation will comprise a significant shift in strategy towards\nmeeting the needs of Gaza's population for humanitarian and commercial goods, civilian reconstruction and\n\ninfrastructure, and legitimate economic activity as well as the security needs of Israel. The Quartet will continue to work\nwith Israel, the Palestinian Authority, and other concerned parties to ensure these arrangements are implemented as\n\nquickly as possible. The Quartet affirms that much work remains to achieve fully the solution stated above, and, in\nconsultation with the concerned parties, it will monitor closely the implementation of the policy in all its aspects. It will\n\n actively explore additional ways to improve the situation in Gaza, encourage involvement of the PA at the crossings and\n promote greater commerce between the West Bank and Gaza.\n\nThe Quartet stresses the importance of United Nations and other international interventions, as well as the work of local\n\n non-governmental organizations, to be expanded in Gaza to meet urgent civilian needs, and calls on all parties to fully\n enable this work.\n\n The Quartet recognizes that Israel has legitimate security concerns that must continue to be safeguarded, and believes\n\n efforts to maintain security while enabling movement and access for Palestinian people and goods are critical. The\n Quartet commits to work with Israel and the international community to prevent the illicit trafficking of arms and\n\n ammunition into Gaza. It urges all those wishing to deliver goods to do so through established channels so that their\n\n     <span class=\"unclassified\">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776736 Date: 08/31/2015</span>\n\ncargo can be inspected and transferred via land crossings into Gaza. The Quartet emphasizes that there is no need for\n\nunnecessary confrontations and calls on all parties to act responsibly in meeting the needs of the people of Gaza.\n\nThe Quartet also calls for an end to the deplorable detention of Gilad Shalit in advance of the fourth anniversary of his\n\ncapture on June 25; it further condemns the violation of Hamas' international obligation to provide him access by the\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross and demands that Hamas immediately remedy the situation.\n\nThe Quartet also reiterates its support for proximity talks toward the resumption, without pre-conditions, of direct\nbilateral negotiations that resolve all final status issues as previously agreed by the parties. The Quartet believes these\n\nnegotiations should lead to a settlement, negotiated between the parties within 24 months, that ends the occupation\nwhich began in 1967 and results in the emergence of an independent, democratic, and viable Palestinian state in the\nWest Bank and Gaza, living side by side in peace and security with Israel and its other neighbours.\n\t\t\t\t</div></div>",

We are working to ascertain the facts.\nWe expect a credible and transparent investigation and strongly urge the Israeli government to investigate the incident\n\nfully.\n\nAs I stated in the Chamber in December 2008, when we were confronted by a similar situation, mechanisms exist for the\ntransfer of humanitarian assistance to Gaza by member states and groups that want to do so. These non-provocative\n\nand non-confrontational mechanisms should be the ones used for the benefit of all those in Gaza. Direct delivery by sea\nis neither appropriate nor responsible, and certainly not effective, under the circumstances.\n\nThe United States remains deeply concerned by the suffering of civilians in Gaza, and the deterioration of the situation\n\nthere, including the humanitarian and human rights situation. We continue to believe the situation is unsustainable and\nis not in the interests of any of those concerned. We will continue to engage the Israelis on a daily basis to expand the\n\nscope and type of goods allowed into Gaza to address the full range of the population's humanitarian and recovery\nneeds. Hamas' interference with international assistance shipments and the work of nongovernmental organizations\n\ncomplicates efforts in Gaza. Its continued arms smuggling and commitment to terrorism undermines security and\nprosperity for Palestinians and Israelis alike.\n\nWe will continue to work closely with the Government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority, along with international\n\nNGOs and the UN, to provide adequate access for humanitarian goods, including reconstruction materials, through the\nborder crossings, while bearing in mind the Government of Israel's legitimate security concerns.\n\nUltimately, this incident underscores the need to move ahead quickly with negotiations that can lead to a\n\ncomprehensive peace in the region. The only viable solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is an agreement,\nnegotiated between the parties, that ends the occupation that began in 1967 and fulfills the aspirations of both parties\n\nfor independent homelands through two states for two peoples, Israel and an independent, contiguous, and viable state\nof Palestine, living side by side in peace and security. We call again on our international partners ï¿½ both inside and\n\noutside this Council ï¿½ to promote an atmosphere of cooperation between the parties and throughout the entire region.\n\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\n###\n\t\t\t\t</div></div>",

That Smits Model effort now has an economically sustainable design with\n\n multiple benefits for the local forest population, the nation of Indonesia, and the planet. The business plan has been\n developed by an experienced and highly reputable investment group that serves in an Advisory role to the Prince of\n\n Wales's Trust, and the business plan has already engaged the interest of the P8, a group of the eight largest global\n pension funds.\n\n The core goals of the Arenga Reforestation Project include greenhouse gas reduction, habitat restoration, rainforest\n\n remediation, deforestation protection, biofuel production that is non-food and carbon-positive, and poverty alleviation\n for some of the most vulnerable populations on the planet. The Internal Rate of Return, on a fairly mature business\n\n model and seven years of module testing, calculates to about 34% -- a decent investment return for almost any industry.\n\n      <span class=\"unclassified\">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775819 Date: 08/31/2015</span>\n\nYou can watch Willie Smits describe the possibilities at TED (to a standing ovation) here:\n\nhttp://www.ted.com/talks/willie_smits_restores_a_rainforest.html\n\nThe State Department has been on the periphery of the concept development through Moira O'Neill, a Haas Professor\nof Business on loan to USAID from Cal. She has kept the conversation going with the White House, USAID, and State, but\n\nis extremely busy with a range of other obligations and may not have the cycles to follow this to a conclusion.\n\nIn my view this effort, the Arenga Reforestation Project, is the leading contender for an economically sustainable\n\ntropical reforestation program, and has an unprecedented climate mitigation potential (Indonesia is the world's #4\ngreenhouse-gas emitter, due largely to the burning and composting of the southern Kalimantan peat swamps and to\n\nrapid destruction of rainforest, both of which the Smits Model can reverse). In Aug 08 I spent 11 days visiting key sites of\nthis project in Borneo, largely with Dr. Smits, whom I've known for about 20 years. In my opinion, and that of many\n\nothers, this is the world's most sophisticated and powerful model for integrated ecological and economic restoration,\nwith exciting prospects for much of the tropics. I can also vouch for the quality and integrity of the key people involved.\n\nTo make the impact even more noteworthy, the Minister of Forestry in Indonesia has now agreed to a 1:1 acreage\nmatch between Smits Model reforestation and the protection of virgin rainforest in perpetuity as national park. For\n\nevery 30,000 hectares of Smits Model reforestation, the Ministry will designate 30,000 hectares (about 116 square\nmiles) of virgin rainforest a National Park, and they have agreed to external monitoring by international NGOs for\n\ncompliance. Since this Smits Model can scale to a million hectares, or ten million, with continually increasing economic,\nsocial, and environmental benefits, the two-fer impact is perhaps unprecedented.\n\nIt would be worthwhile for you to have someone from your staff take a look at this. In my carefully considered view, the\n\npolitical, social, and REDD benefits could be very substantial, and the possibility of a Public-Private Partnership is worth\nconsideration.\n\nThe primary source for information on the project in the US is my friend and Senior Fellow at RMI, the remarkable Eric\n\n Rasmussen, MD, MDM, FACP CEO of the Google-founded humanitarian NGO called InSTEDD.

Where are the\n  grief and sadness that Israelis ought to feel about a military operation gone awry? The\n  French philosopher Bernard-Henri Levy expressed anger with the tendency of some\n  and to act accordingly.\"ve that \"they are alone in the world and will always be blamed,\n\n  Israel's friends know that the country has a case to make. But by hunkering down in self-\n  justification, Israel has confused that case. And now the jury of world public opinion,\n  comprising at least as many friends as foes, has stopped listening. At the United\n  Nations, speaker after speaker condemned Israel's action, and even the United States\n  joined in a harsh statement of condemnation. Normally pro-Israel editorial writers\n  added to the chorus of ostracism.\n\n  Israel has long seen itself as the Alamo, a fortress under siege. Decades ago, a song titled\n  truth to the words: Arab states rejected Israel's existence. An Arab economic boycottome\n  persuaded major companies in Europe and Asia to decline to do business in Israel.\n  Trade with many countries had to be conducted through third parties.\n\n  Indeed, Israel has faced recurring threats to its security and existence, a reality reflected\n  in a maxim I heard often during my time as U.S. ambassador there early this decade:\n  Israel goes to sleep with memories of the Holocaust and wakes up to the Arab-Israeli\n  conflict. In this context, the nation's military power was seen as a necessary response.\n  And in turn, Israel's narrative portrayed the country as a David facing an Arab Goliath.\n\n  Although the 1967 war changed this reality, Israel's narrative never really caught up.\n  Newly demonstrated military superiority and deepening ties with the United States\n  Anwar Sadat was the first Arab leader to recognize this new strategic reality, and in\n  1979, he made peace with Israel.\n\n<span class=\"unclassified\">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775117 Date: 08/31/2015</span>\n\n  But even as the outdated David vs. Goliath theme lingered in the minds of many Israelis,\n  among other segments of the population a new, religious-national narrative that\n  centered on settling and holding all of Eretz Israel was taking hold. Even though\n  settlements complicated Israel's relations with the Palestinians, and even though Israel\n  had evacuated the Sinai settlements to make peace with Egypt -- a move that vitiated the\n  argument that settlements were required for security -- activists such as Ariel Sharon\n  continued to argue that they enhanced security.\n\n  For a while, conditions allowed this new narrative to take root: The Palestine Liberation\n  Organization was busy attacking Israel from Jordan, Lebanon and the United Nations\n  and pursuing a tactical moderation designed to lull Israel into complacency.\n\n  But soon this reality, too, began to change. The PLO decided in 1988 to officially support\n  a two-state solution to the conflict and entered into dialogue with the United States. In\n  1991, Arab states participated in multilateral negotiations with Israel on water, the\n  environment, economic development and regional security. Arab and Israeli business\n  leaders met at international conferences. Israel's diplomatic isolation eased as China,\n  India and others established formal ties, and Israeli liaison offices opened in Morocco\n  and Arab states in the Persian Gulf. In 1994, Jordan made peace, removing the security\n\n  justification for Israeli settlements in the West Bank. And in  2002, Arab states\n  announced an \"Arab peace initiative\" offering peace and security in return for Israel's\n  withdrawal from lands taken in the 1967 war.\n\n  But the Palestinian intifada put a brake on these developments, ushering in a decade of\n  violence. As Palestinian terrorists attacked not only soldiers and settlers in the occupied\n  territories, but also civilians in Israeli cities, the Israeli storyline of the 19505 -- David vs.\n  Goliath -- revived.\n\n  I arrived in Israel as the U.S. ambassador in  2001, right after the first Palestinian suicide\n  bombing, and discussed these issues often with then-Prime Minister Sharon, usually in\n  the context of the choices Israel made in dealing with terrorism. Sharon believed that a\n  strong and unyielding military response was all that was needed to persuade\n  Palestinians to stop the intifada. A terrorist attack in Tel Aviv would often lead him to\n\n  impose a closure on Gaza, preventing the movement of people and goods.\n\n  A typical conversation with Sharon on this subject went something as follows: I would\n  suggest that the closure on Gaza would be seen by the media and even friendly\n  governments as collective punishment, would shift the media's story line from\n  Palestinian violence to Israel's reaction and could even drive Palestinians hurt by the\n  closure into the terrorist camp.

Where are the\n  grief and sadness that Israelis ought to feel about a military operation gone awry? The\n  French philosopher Bernard-Henri Levy expressed anger with the tendency of some\n  and to act accordingly.\"ve that \"they are alone in the world and will always be blamed,\n\n  Israel's friends know that the country has a case to make. But by hunkering down in self-\n  justification, Israel has confused that case. And now the jury of world public opinion,\n  comprising at least as many friends as foes, has stopped listening. At the United\n  Nations, speaker after speaker condemned Israel's action, and even the United States\n  joined in a harsh statement of condemnation. Normally pro-Israel editorial writers\n  added to the chorus of ostracism.\n\n  Israel has long seen itself as the Alamo, a fortress under siege. Decades ago, a song titled\n  truth to the words: Arab states rejected Israel's existence. An Arab economic boycottome\n  persuaded major companies in Europe and Asia to decline to do business in Israel.\n  Trade with many countries had to be conducted through third parties.\n\n  Indeed, Israel has faced recurring threats to its security and existence, a reality reflected\n  in a maxim I heard often during my time as U.S. ambassador there early this decade:\n  Israel goes to sleep with memories of the Holocaust and wakes up to the Arab-Israeli\n  conflict. In this context, the nation's military power was seen as a necessary response.\n  And in turn, Israel's narrative portrayed the country as a David facing an Arab Goliath.\n\n  Although the 1967 war changed this reality, Israel's narrative never really caught up.\n  Newly demonstrated military superiority and deepening ties with the United States\n  Anwar Sadat was the first Arab leader to recognize this new strategic reality, and in\n  1979, he made peace with Israel.\n\nUNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775117 Date: 08/31/2015\n\n  But even as the outdated David vs. Goliath theme lingered in the minds of many Israelis,\n  among other segments of the population a new, religious-national narrative that\n  centered on settling and holding all of Eretz Israel was taking hold. Even though\n  settlements complicated Israel's relations with the Palestinians, and even though Israel\n  had evacuated the Sinai settlements to make peace with Egypt -- a move that vitiated the\n  argument that settlements were required for security -- activists such as Ariel Sharon\n  continued to argue that they enhanced security.\n\n  For a while, conditions allowed this new narrative to take root: The Palestine Liberation\n  Organization was busy attacking Israel from Jordan, Lebanon and the United Nations\n  and pursuing a tactical moderation designed to lull Israel into complacency.\n\n  But soon this reality, too, began to change. The PLO decided in 1988 to officially support\n  a two-state solution to the conflict and entered into dialogue with the United States. In\n  1991, Arab states participated in multilateral negotiations with Israel on water, the\n  environment, economic development and regional security. Arab and Israeli business\n  leaders met at international conferences. Israel's diplomatic isolation eased as China,\n  India and others established formal ties, and Israeli liaison offices opened in Morocco\n  and Arab states in the Persian Gulf. In 1994, Jordan made peace, removing the security\n\n  justification for Israeli settlements in the West Bank. And in  2002, Arab states\n  announced an \"Arab peace initiative\" offering peace and security in return for Israel's\n  withdrawal from lands taken in the 1967 war.\n\n  But the Palestinian intifada put a brake on these developments, ushering in a decade of\n  violence. As Palestinian terrorists attacked not only soldiers and settlers in the occupied\n  territories, but also civilians in Israeli cities, the Israeli storyline of the 19505 -- David vs.\n  Goliath -- revived.\n\n  I arrived in Israel as the U.S. ambassador in  2001, right after the first Palestinian suicide\n  bombing, and discussed these issues often with then-Prime Minister Sharon, usually in\n  the context of the choices Israel made in dealing with terrorism. Sharon believed that a\n  strong and unyielding military response was all that was needed to persuade\n  Palestinians to stop the intifada. A terrorist attack in Tel Aviv would often lead him to\n\n  impose a closure on Gaza, preventing the movement of people and goods.\n\n  A typical conversation with Sharon on this subject went something as follows: I would\n  suggest that the closure on Gaza would be seen by the media and even friendly\n  governments as collective punishment, would shift the media's story line from\n  Palestinian violence to Israel's reaction and could even drive Palestinians hurt by the\n  closure into the terrorist camp. Sharon would reply that his responsibility was to protect\n  Israelis, that the Gaza closure was designed to prevent further attacks and that the\n  media were to blame for distorting reality.\n\n  His underlying point was clear: Any impact on Israel's image and on the long-term\n  possibility of a widened conflict was outweighed by the need to prevent the next suicide\n\n  bombing. Whatever the consequences of its actions, Israel would not apologize for\n  defending itself.\n\nUNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775117 Date: 08/31/2015\n\n   Netanyahu would echo this refrain almost a decade later, after years marked not only by\n   the intifada but by an Israeli decision to build a security barrier.

With 14 years at the helm of the small but influential foundation, Ms. Delaney has had a\npronounced and lasting influence on quality of life in our region.\n\nOn behalf of FISA, Ms. Delaney has changed the local landscape not only by funding projects with far-reaching results,\nbut by bringing people together to craft solutions to longstanding problems and by becoming personally involved in\n\nmany of the projects the foundation funds.\n\nShe became the first executive director of FISA Foundation when it began in 1996 with proceeds from the sale of\n\nHarmarville Rehabilitation Center, a nonprofit, to HealthSouth, a for-profit organization.\n\nThe new foundation would continue the mission of the Federation of Independent School Alumnae, an organization that\nopened a convalescent home for women in 1911 and the Harmarville Rehabilitation Center in 1954. That mission was to\nimprove the lives of women, girls and people with disabilities in Western Pennsylvania.\n\nMs. Delaney, who had been involved with Harmarville since 1980 -- starting as a volunteer and ending as development\ndirector of its foundation -- sought the job of leading FISA. \"I realized the impact the foundation could have. FISA is not a\n\nlarge foundation, but it's a very focused foundation,\" she said.\n\nOver the past 14 years, FISA's endowment has grown to more than $38 million. Over $17 million has been granted to\n\n726 projects in 298 organizations.\n\nA roll call of projects funded by FISA reflects progressive thinking about including of people with disabilities in all aspects\n\nof life, especially access to health care. Programs have become national models.\n\nWomen with disabilities, for example, often encounter barriers in typical healthcare settings. Standard exam tables and\n\ndiagnostic equipment were designed for the able-bodied, and medical staff often struggle to accommodate individuals\nwith special needs. FISA provided the seed money for the Center for Women with Disabilities at Magee-Womens\nHospital of UPMC, one of the first such clinics in the nation. FISA is involved in the overall issue of improving access to\n\n healthcare for people with disabilities.\n\n Likewise, people with disabilities have difficulty obtaining dental care. A FISA-funded project at Achieva is creating\n\nstatewide, systemic solutions. FISA also provided support for the Center for Patients with Special Needs at Pitt's School\nof Dental Medicine.\n\n FISA has also taken the lead on training arts and cultural venues how to make events more accessible and helping places\n of worship more welcoming.\n\n\"Dee is a national leader in the field. If there were more people like her, we wouldn't have the issues we have,\" said Kim\n Hutchinson, executive director of the Disability Funders Network, based in Virginia. Ms. Delaney has been a board officer\n\n for the group since 2004.\n\n       <span class=\"unclassified\">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774936 Date: 08/31/2015</span>\n\nNancy Murray, president of the ARC of Greater Pittsburgh, said the issues Ms. Delaney has helped solve are ones that\npeople have been working on for years.\n\n\"People talk about strategies, but never move forward to solutions. Dee brings all the stakeholders together to get to\nthe solutions,\" said Ms. Murray.\n\n\"I think Dee has greatly influenced the next generation of nonprofit and philanthropic leaders, leading by example on\n\nthe value of true collaboration,\" said Susie Chase, a board member of FISA and former executive director of Working\nOrder, a FISA grantee.\n\n\"With Dee, it is never about her own role, or FISA's role, it is always about unmet needs in the community and the work\nthat needs to be done. That seems to bring out the best in every partner, and in everyone who has the privilege of\nworking with her.\"\n\nMs. Chase added that advice and technical assistance Ms. Delaney provided to Working Order \"were of equal or greater\n\nvalue to the organization than the grant funds.\"\n\n\"I still, after many years, never come away from a meeting with Dee that I haven't learned something, been inspired to\n\nwork harder, and understood more clearly the value of someone else's ideas and efforts.\"\n\nIn her retirement, Ms. Delaney plans to \"give back to the community in new ways,\" she said. A new frontier is helping\n\nyoung people with disabilities prepare for employment and leadership. \"We have to keep the fire burning.\"\n\nOn May 19, FISA announced that Kristy Trautmann, who has served as the foundation's program director for six years,\n\nwas promoted to executive director.\n\n\"We sought a person who would follow Ms. Delaney's visionary leadership and guide the foundation into the next\n\ndecade,\" said Jane Burger, who chaired the search committee. \"We know that we have found such a person in Kristy\nTrautmann. She understands the challenges facing the populations the foundation supports and has the trust of the\nboard and the community.\"\n\t\t\t\t</div></div>",

With 14 years at the helm of the small but influential foundation, Ms. Delaney has had a\npronounced and lasting influence on quality of life in our region.\n\nOn behalf of FISA, Ms. Delaney has changed the local landscape not only by funding projects with far-reaching results,\nbut by bringing people together to craft solutions to longstanding problems and by becoming personally involved in\n\nmany of the projects the foundation funds.\n\nShe became the first executive director of FISA Foundation when it began in 1996 with proceeds from the sale of\n\nHarmarville Rehabilitation Center, a nonprofit, to HealthSouth, a for-profit organization.\n\nThe new foundation would continue the mission of the Federation of Independent School Alumnae, an organization that\nopened a convalescent home for women in 1911 and the Harmarville Rehabilitation Center in 1954. That mission was to\nimprove the lives of women, girls and people with disabilities in Western Pennsylvania.\n\nMs. Delaney, who had been involved with Harmarville since 1980 -- starting as a volunteer and ending as development\ndirector of its foundation -- sought the job of leading FISA. \"I realized the impact the foundation could have. FISA is not a\n\nlarge foundation, but it's a very focused foundation,\" she said.\n\nOver the past 14 years, FISA's endowment has grown to more than $38 million. Over $17 million has been granted to\n\n726 projects in 298 organizations.\n\nA roll call of projects funded by FISA reflects progressive thinking about including of people with disabilities in all aspects\n\nof life, especially access to health care. Programs have become national models.\n\nWomen with disabilities, for example, often encounter barriers in typical healthcare settings. Standard exam tables and\n\ndiagnostic equipment were designed for the able-bodied, and medical staff often struggle to accommodate individuals\nwith special needs. FISA provided the seed money for the Center for Women with Disabilities at Magee-Womens\nHospital of UPMC, one of the first such clinics in the nation. FISA is involved in the overall issue of improving access to\n\n healthcare for people with disabilities.\n\n Likewise, people with disabilities have difficulty obtaining dental care. A FISA-funded project at Achieva is creating\n\nstatewide, systemic solutions. FISA also provided support for the Center for Patients with Special Needs at Pitt's School\nof Dental Medicine.\n\n FISA has also taken the lead on training arts and cultural venues how to make events more accessible and helping places\n of worship more welcoming.\n\n\"Dee is a national leader in the field. If there were more people like her, we wouldn't have the issues we have,\" said Kim\n Hutchinson, executive director of the Disability Funders Network, based in Virginia. Ms. Delaney has been a board officer\n\n for the group since 2004.\n\n       UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774936 Date: 08/31/2015\n\nNancy Murray, president of the ARC of Greater Pittsburgh, said the issues Ms. Delaney has helped solve are ones that\npeople have been working on for years.\n\n\"People talk about strategies, but never move forward to solutions. Dee brings all the stakeholders together to get to\nthe solutions,\" said Ms. Murray.\n\n\"I think Dee has greatly influenced the next generation of nonprofit and philanthropic leaders, leading by example on\n\nthe value of true collaboration,\" said Susie Chase, a board member of FISA and former executive director of Working\nOrder, a FISA grantee.\n\n\"With Dee, it is never about her own role, or FISA's role, it is always about unmet needs in the community and the work\nthat needs to be done. That seems to bring out the best in every partner, and in everyone who has the privilege of\nworking with her.\"\n\nMs. Chase added that advice and technical assistance Ms. Delaney provided to Working Order \"were of equal or greater\n\nvalue to the organization than the grant funds.\"\n\n\"I still, after many years, never come away from a meeting with Dee that I haven't learned something, been inspired to\n\nwork harder, and understood more clearly the value of someone else's ideas and efforts.\"\n\nIn her retirement, Ms. Delaney plans to \"give back to the community in new ways,\" she said. A new frontier is helping\n\nyoung people with disabilities prepare for employment and leadership. \"We have to keep the fire burning.\"\n\nOn May 19, FISA announced that Kristy Trautmann, who has served as the foundation's program director for six years,\n\nwas promoted to executive director.\n\n\"We sought a person who would follow Ms. Delaney's visionary leadership and guide the foundation into the next\n\ndecade,\" said Jane Burger, who chaired the search committee. \"We know that we have found such a person in Kristy\nTrautmann. She understands the challenges facing the populations the foundation supports and has the trust of the\nboard and the community.\"\n\t\t\t\t"

Almost no educational institutions have\n\n taken a stand in defense of democracy and even western Ukrainian politicians are capitulating under pressure. So is\n business. The approach of the new authorities is quick and systematic. Top and middle positions in all spheres of\n\n government, administration, state security, police have been rapidly changed and are effectively moving in on the\n freedom of the press and discourse.\n\n         Our students are scared.\n         Some are active, but some fear for the university, that it may loose accreditation. A father and his daughter-\n\n student came to my office in a state of anxiety.\n         Some students are afraid to blog and post comments because they fear that they will be traced and that their\n\n parents will loose their jobs.\n\n       <span class=\"unclassified\">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774929 Date: 08/31/2015</span>\n\n         There is clear evidence from one of our banks that the authorities are beginning to dig into the question of our\n\nfinances. Provocations, moral defamation, planting of drugs and weapons in student residences as happened in 2004\n before the election could be next.\n\n         The most effective defense is speaking out.\n\n         I am grateful for your solicitude and wanted to ask for two things.\n\n         1 To ask the Secretary of State to bring this to the attention of the president and vice president and to do what\nshe can in our defense.\n\n         2. to help us get the story to some of the main media outlets: New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street\n\nJournal, CNN, etc. One story by any of these for us and for the people in Ukraine that have the courage to speak the\ntruth is invaluable.\n\n        We have had some great support already. But I have a sense that this adventure is only beginning and we have\nto be ready for everything.\n\n        Please pass on my respect to Secretary Clinton.\n\n        May God bless you!\n\n        Fr.

The approach of the new authorities is quick and systematic. Top and middle positions in all spheres of\n\n government, administration, state security, police have been rapidly changed and are effectively moving in on the\n freedom of the press and discourse.\n\n         Our students are scared.\n         Some are active, but some fear for the university, that it may loose accreditation. A father and his daughter-\n\n student came to my office in a state of anxiety.\n         Some students are afraid to blog and post comments because they fear that they will be traced and that their\n\n parents will loose their jobs.\n\n       UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774929 Date: 08/31/2015\n\n         There is clear evidence from one of our banks that the authorities are beginning to dig into the question of our\n\nfinances. Provocations, moral defamation, planting of drugs and weapons in student residences as happened in 2004\n before the election could be next.\n\n         The most effective defense is speaking out.\n\n         I am grateful for your solicitude and wanted to ask for two things.\n\n         1 To ask the Secretary of State to bring this to the attention of the president and vice president and to do what\nshe can in our defense.\n\n         2. to help us get the story to some of the main media outlets: New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street\n\nJournal, CNN, etc. One story by any of these for us and for the people in Ukraine that have the courage to speak the\ntruth is invaluable.\n\n        We have had some great support already. But I have a sense that this adventure is only beginning and we have\nto be ready for everything.\n\n        Please pass on my respect to Secretary Clinton.\n\n        May God bless you!\n\n        Fr. Borys\n\t\t\t\t"

Congressman McGovern also strongly encouraged the Secretary to meet with representatives of those\norganizations and individuals being threatened, with a particularly effort to reach out to and invite the Bishops of\n\nTumaco (Narifio), Barrancabermeja/Medio Magdalena (Santander), and we would now add Putumayo, since the\nColombian Catholic Church just advised us yesterday of increased death threats against religious workers there. In\n\naddition, we recommended inviting Monsefior Hector Fabio Henao, director of Pastoral Social, at the Archdiocese in\nBogota, who represents all the pastoral work of the Church throughout the country, as well as representatives from the\n\nMennonite and Lutheran churches, in particular.\n\nWhile in Colombia, the most important thing the Secretary can do is avoid effusive praise for President Alvaro Uribe,\nwho leaves office in August. Inside Colombia, the visit by the Secretary is being described as focusing solely on the free\n\ntrade agreement and continuing support of the counterdrug strategy/Plan Colombia. Without changes in the human\nrights situation and the culture of impunity, it is unlikely that anything the Secretary might say or do will alter the\n\nequation on Capitol Hill regarding the trade agreement. It should be noted that the October 2008 GAO report on the\ncounter-drug operations in Colombia concluded that U.S. assistance was successful in increasing security in parts of the\n\ncountry, but a failure in the areas of counter-narcotics (GAO-09-71) , and a subsequent April 2009 USAID evaluation on\n\nU.S. aid for Plan Colombia for illegal crop reduction and Colombian counternarcotics policies actually contribute to\nincreased coca production.\n\n      <span class=\"unclassified\">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775063 Date: 08/31/2015</span>\n\nThe Colombian president has been a solid backer of U.S. policy and U.S. interests in the region, and has achieved some\n\nimportant improvements in the country's security situation. It is important to recognize that, but to do so without\nrepeating the tone of Defense Secretary Gates' April visit, in which he called Uribe a \"great hero\"\n<http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=58754> and failed even to mention any concerns.\n\nThese concerns are of critical importance, and while the Secretary need not list them all, at least some deserve public\nacknowledgement some recognition that it is important to the United States that Colombia, including the current\n\ngovernment and its successor, show the necessary political will to deal with them:\n\n      Asharp rise in alleged military killings of civilians. In many cases, these are so-called \"false positives\": non-\ncombatants murdered and later presented as members of armed groups killed in combat. These, notes\n<http://www.extrajudicialexecutions.org/colombia    > UN Special Rapporter for Extrajudicial Executions Philip Alston,\n\n\"began occurring with a disturbing frequency across Colombia from2004.\" Citing prosecutors' and NGOs' reports, Alston\nindicates that Colombia's security forces may have killed 1,486 civilians during the first six years of Alvaro Uribe's\npresidency. Alston notes that the Defense Ministry only began to address the situation after the media broke the story\n\nof the false-positives and the subsequent negative publicity and horrified public outcry.\n\nThe prosecution of \"false positives\" is moving with excruciating slowness. In perhaps the most notorious case ï¿½the\n\nmurders of about twenty young men fromthe poor Bogota suburb of Soacha ï¿½nearly all of the accused soldiers and\nofficers have been released from prison <http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=49968>, pending trial, as\ndeadlines for timely prosecution have run out. Since their arrest in late 2008, their case has been prolonged by\n\nnumerous delaying tactics by the defense, including attempts to have their cases tried in the military court systemas\n\"acts of service.\" Alston reports that the impunity rate on these extrajudicial murders by security forces may be as high\nas 98.5 percent.\n\n      Mounting allegations that the President's intelligence service, the DAS, was put at the service\n<http://www.cipcol.org/?p=1123    > of paramilitary leaders and narcotraffickers; used  to spy on and intimidate\n\n<http://www.cipcol.org/?p=752> Supreme Court justices, opposition politicians, journalists and human rights\ndefenders; and employed in a campaign of sabotage and smears <http://www.cipcol.org/?p=1467          > against political\nopponents.\n\nProsecutors are alleging that the orders to have the DAS carry out wiretaps, surveillance and \"political warfare\" came\nfrom high up in the Colombian presidency <http://www.caracoltv.com/noticias/justicia/articulo168592-tres-asesores-\n\nde-uribe-son-investigados-chuzadas-ilegales> , though the question of \"what President Uribe knew, and when he knew\nit\" remains unanswered. Meanwhile efforts to reformor dissolve the DAS are stalled in Colombia's Congress.\n\n      President Uribe's political coalition has also been hit by a scandal known in Colombia as \"para-politics.\" This\ncoalition has included dozens of political bosses fromregions beyond the capital. Many are large landholders with ties to\nnarcotrafficking, the same local leaders who created and fostered the brutal pro-government paramilitary groups that\n\nkilled tens of thousands of non-combatants in the 1990s and early 2000s.\n\n Evidence, much of it fromformer paramilitary leaders, has brought about 300 criminal investigations against legislators,\n\ngovernors, mayors and other local officials, nearly all of themAlvaro Uribe's political supporters, who made common\n cause with the far-right warlords. To date, of the 278 congresspeople and senators elected in 2006, 68\n <http://www.nuevoarcoiris.org.co/sac/?q=node/64> are under official investigation, on trial, or convicted for\n\n paramilitary ties. Those embroiled in parapolitics include the President's cousin, Mario Uribe; the brother of his former\n foreign minister; and individuals whomthe President had named to be Colombia's ambassadors to Chile, the Dominican\n Republic, and Canada.\n\n The Colombian prosecutors, investigators, witnesses and non-governmental organizations trying to uncover the truth\n\n about these abuses are working under conditions of great personal risk. They, too, are heroes and would benefit greatly\n froma public expression of concern about the cases they are investigating, and a reminder that their work is legitimate\n and important to U.S. interests in Colombia.\n\n      <span class=\"unclassified\">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775063 Date: 08/31/2015</span>\n\nAt the same time, it is important to avoid appearing to endorse any candidate in the June 20 runoff elections. Between\nthe first and second rounds of a country's presidential election is a politically awkward time for a high-level official visit.\n\nThough President Uribe's former defense minister, Juan Manuel Santos, is the overwhelming favorite given his margin of\nsuccess in the May 30th first round of balloting over former Bogota mayor Antanas Mockus, it is necessary at this stage\nto convey a sense of balance and a willingness to work closely with whoever wins. As a result, any kind words for one\n\ncandidate should be balanced by praise for the other.\n\nFinally, it would be helpful to remind the Colombian people that the United States supports a peaceful resolution of\n\nBogota's worsening differences with Venezuela. While President Chavez's behavior is a significant concern, it would be\nmost unhelpful to be perceived on this trip as fanning the flames of conflict with Colombia ï¿½ or playing into the Chavez\nrhetoric that the U.S. and Colombia have military aspirations in the region.\n\nHope this memo, along with last week's copy of the TLHRC letter to Assistant Secretary Posner, are helpful and useful\n\nmaterials for the Secretary as she plans her trip.\n\nVery best wishes ï¿½\n\nOn behalf of Cong. Jim McGovern\n\n                                                                           <mailto:cindy.buhl@mail.house.gov    > )\nStaff Contact: Cindy Buhl (202-225-6101 or cindy.buhl@mail.house.gov\n\t\t\t\t</div></div>",

Since their arrest in late 2008, their case has been prolonged by\n\nnumerous delaying tactics by the defense, including attempts to have their cases tried in the military court systemas\n\"acts of service.\" Alston reports that the impunity rate on these extrajudicial murders by security forces may be as high\nas 98.5 percent.\n\n      Mounting allegations that the President's intelligence service, the DAS, was put at the service\n<http://www.cipcol.org/?p=1123    > of paramilitary leaders and narcotraffickers; used  to spy on and intimidate\n\n<http://www.cipcol.org/?p=752> Supreme Court justices, opposition politicians, journalists and human rights\ndefenders; and employed in a campaign of sabotage and smears <http://www.cipcol.org/?p=1467          > against political\nopponents.\n\nProsecutors are alleging that the orders to have the DAS carry out wiretaps, surveillance and \"political warfare\" came\nfrom high up in the Colombian presidency <http://www.caracoltv.com/noticias/justicia/articulo168592-tres-asesores-\n\nde-uribe-son-investigados-chuzadas-ilegales> , though the question of \"what President Uribe knew, and when he knew\nit\" remains unanswered. Meanwhile efforts to reformor dissolve the DAS are stalled in Colombia's Congress.\n\n      President Uribe's political coalition has also been hit by a scandal known in Colombia as \"para-politics.\" This\ncoalition has included dozens of political bosses fromregions beyond the capital. Many are large landholders with ties to\nnarcotrafficking, the same local leaders who created and fostered the brutal pro-government paramilitary groups that\n\nkilled tens of thousands of non-combatants in the 1990s and early 2000s.\n\n Evidence, much of it fromformer paramilitary leaders, has brought about 300 criminal investigations against legislators,\n\ngovernors, mayors and other local officials, nearly all of themAlvaro Uribe's political supporters, who made common\n cause with the far-right warlords. To date, of the 278 congresspeople and senators elected in 2006, 68\n <http://www.nuevoarcoiris.org.co/sac/?q=node/64> are under official investigation, on trial, or convicted for\n\n paramilitary ties. Those embroiled in parapolitics include the President's cousin, Mario Uribe; the brother of his former\n foreign minister; and individuals whomthe President had named to be Colombia's ambassadors to Chile, the Dominican\n Republic, and Canada.\n\n The Colombian prosecutors, investigators, witnesses and non-governmental organizations trying to uncover the truth\n\n about these abuses are working under conditions of great personal risk. They, too, are heroes and would benefit greatly\n froma public expression of concern about the cases they are investigating, and a reminder that their work is legitimate\n and important to U.S. interests in Colombia.\n\n      UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775063 Date: 08/31/2015\n\nAt the same time, it is important to avoid appearing to endorse any candidate in the June 20 runoff elections. Between\nthe first and second rounds of a country's presidential election is a politically awkward time for a high-level official visit.\n\nThough President Uribe's former defense minister, Juan Manuel Santos, is the overwhelming favorite given his margin of\nsuccess in the May 30th first round of balloting over former Bogota mayor Antanas Mockus, it is necessary at this stage\nto convey a sense of balance and a willingness to work closely with whoever wins. As a result, any kind words for one\n\ncandidate should be balanced by praise for the other.\n\nFinally, it would be helpful to remind the Colombian people that the United States supports a peaceful resolution of\n\nBogota's worsening differences with Venezuela. While President Chavez's behavior is a significant concern, it would be\nmost unhelpful to be perceived on this trip as fanning the flames of conflict with Colombia ï¿½ or playing into the Chavez\nrhetoric that the U.S. and Colombia have military aspirations in the region.\n\nHope this memo, along with last week's copy of the TLHRC letter to Assistant Secretary Posner, are helpful and useful\n\nmaterials for the Secretary as she plans her trip.\n\nVery best wishes ï¿½\n\nOn behalf of Cong. Jim McGovern\n\n                                                                           <mailto:cindy.buhl@mail.house.gov    > )\nStaff Contact: Cindy Buhl (202-225-6101 or cindy.buhl@mail.house.gov\n\t\t\t\t"

Congressman McGovern also strongly encouraged the Secretary to meet with representatives of those\norganizations and individuals being threatened, with a particularly effort to reach out to and invite the Bishops of\n\nTumaco (Narifio), Barrancabermeja/Medio Magdalena (Santander), and we would now add Putumayo, since the\nColombian Catholic Church just advised us yesterday of increased death threats against religious workers there. In\n\naddition, we recommended inviting Monserior Hector Fabio Henao, director of Pastoral Social, at the Archdiocese in\nBogota, who represents all the pastoral work of the Church throughout the country, as well as representatives from the\n\n Mennonite and Lutheran churches, in particular.\n\nWhile in Colombia, the most important thing the Secretary can do is avoid effusive praise for President Alvaro Uribe,\nwho leaves office in August. Inside Colombia, the visit by the Secretary is being described as focusing solely on the free\n\ntrade agreement and continuing support of the counterdrug strategy/Plan Colombia. Without changes in the human\n rights situation and the culture of impunity, it is unlikely that anything the Secretary might say or do will alter the\n\nequation on Capitol Hill regarding the trade agreement. It should be noted that the October 2008 GAO report on the\ncounter-drug operations in Colombia concluded that U.S. assistance was successful in increasing security in parts of the\n\ncountry, but a failure in the areas of counter-narcotics (GAO-09-71) , and a subsequent April 2009 USAID evaluation on\n U.S. aid for Plan Colombia for illegal crop reduction and Colombian counternarcotics policies actually contribute to\n\n increased coca production.\n\n      <span class=\"unclassified\">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775576 Date: 08/31/2015</span>\n\nThe Colombian president has been a solid backer of U.S. policy and U.S. interests in the region, and has achieved some\nimportant improvements in the country's security situation. It is important to recognize that, but to do so without\n\nrepeating the tone of Defense Secretary Gates' April visit, in which he called Uribe a \"great hero\"\n<http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=58754> and failed even to mention any concerns.\n\nThese concerns are of critical importance, and while the Secretary need not list them all, at least some deserve public\nacknowledgement ï¿½ some recognition that it is important to the United States that Colombia, including the current\n\ngovernment and its successor, show the necessary political will to deal with them:\n\n      A sharp rise in alleged military killings of civilians. In many cases, these are so-called \"false positives\": non-\n\ncombatants murdered and later presented as members of armed groups killed in combat. These, notes\n<http://www.extrajudicialexecutions.org/colombia     > UN Special Rapporter for Extrajudicial Executions Philip Alston,\n\"began occurring with a disturbing frequency across Colombia from 2004.\" Citing prosecutors' and NGOs' reports, Alston\n\nindicates that Colombia's security forces may have killed 1,486 civilians during the first six years of Alvaro Uribe's\npresidency. Alston notes that the Defense Ministry only began to address the situation after the media broke the story\n\nof the false-positives and the subsequent negative publicity and horrified public outcry.\n\nThe prosecution of \"false positives\" is moving with excruciating slowness. In perhaps the most notorious case ï¿½ the\n\nmurders of about twenty young men from the poor Bogota suburb of Soacha ï¿½ nearly all of the accused soldiers and\nofficers have been released from prison <http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=49968           >, pending trial, as\ndeadlines for timely prosecution have run out. Since their arrest in late 2008, their case has been prolonged by\n\nnumerous delaying tactics by the defense, including attempts to have their cases tried in the military court system as\n\"acts of service.\" Alston reports that the impunity rate on these extrajudicial murders by security forces may be as high\nas 98.5 percent.\n\n      Mounting allegations that the President's intelligence service, the DAS, was put at the service\n<http://www.cipcol.org/?p=1123> of paramilitary leaders and narcotraffickers; used to spy on and intimidate\n\n<http://www.cipcol.org/?p=752> Supreme Court justices, opposition politicians, journalists and human rights\ndefenders; and employed in a campaign of sabotage and smears <http://www.cipcol.or.g/?p=1467> against political\n\nopponents.\n\n Prosecutors are alleging that the orders to have the DAS carry out wiretaps, surveillance and \"political warfare\" came\n\nfrom high up in the Colombian presidency <http://www.caracoltv.com/noticias/justicia/articulo168592-tres-asesores-\nde-uribe-son-investigados-chuzadas-ilegales   > , though the question of \"what President Uribe knew, and when he knew\nit\" remains unanswered. Meanwhile efforts to reform or dissolve the DAS are stalled in Colombia's Congress.\n\nï¿½     President Uribe's political coalition has also been hit by a scandal known in Colombia as \"para-politics.\" This\ncoalition has included dozens of political bosses from regions beyond the capital. Many are large landholders with ties to\n\n narcotrafficking, the same local leaders who created and fostered the brutal pro-government paramilitary groups that\n killed tens of thousands of non-combatants in the 1990s and early 2000s.\n\n Evidence, much of it from former paramilitary leaders, has brought about 300 criminal investigations against legislators,\n governors, mayors and other local officials, nearly all of them Alvaro Uribe's political supporters, who made common\n cause with the far-right warlords. To date, of the 278 congresspeople and senators elected in 2006, 68\n\n <http://www.nuevoarcoiris.org.co/sac/?q=node/64> are under official investigation, on trial, or convicted for\n paramilitary ties. Those embroiled in parapolitics include the President's cousin, Mario Uribe; the brother of his former\n foreign minister; and individuals whom the President had named to be Colombia's ambassadors to Chile, the Dominican\n\n Republic, and Canada.\n\n The Colombian prosecutors, investigators, witnesses and non-governmental organizations trying to uncover the truth\n about these abuses are working under conditions of great personal risk. They, too, are heroes and would benefit greatly\n\n      <span class=\"unclassified\">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775576 Date: 08/31/2015</span>\n\nfrom a public expression of concern about the cases they are investigating, and a reminder that their work is legitimate\nand important to U.S. interests in Colombia.\n\nAt the same time, it is important to avoid appearing to endorse any candidate in the June 20 runoff elections. Between\nthe first and second rounds of a country's presidential election is a politically awkward time for a high-level official visit.\nThough President Uribe's former defense minister, Juan Manuel Santos, is the overwhelming favorite given his margin of\n\nsuccess in the May 30th first round of balloting over former Bogota mayor Antanas Mockus, it is necessary at this stage\nto convey a sense of balance and a willingness to work closely with whoever wins. As a result, any kind words for one\n\ncandidate should be balanced by praise for the other.\n\nFinally, it would be helpful to remind the Colombian people that the United States supports a peaceful resolution of\n\nBogota's worsening differences with Venezuela. While President Chavez's behavior is a significant concern, it would be\nmost unhelpful to be perceived on this trip as fanning the flames of conflict with Colombia ï¿½ or playing into the Chavez\nrhetoric that the U.S. and Colombia have military aspirations in the region.\n\nHope this memo, along with last week's copy of the TLHRC letter to Assistant Secretary Posner, are helpful and useful\n\nmaterials for the Secretary as she plans her trip.\n\nVery best wishes ï¿½\n\nOn behalf of Cong. Jim McGovern\n\nStaff Contact: Cindy Buhl (202-225-6101 or cindy.buhl@mail.house.gov     <mailto:cindy.buhl@mail.house.gov    >)\n\t\t\t\t</div></div>",

We did not make\n\nconcessions on our red lines and they failed to make us fold and to drag us to places we didn't want to go, said\nNetanyahu, according to people who heard him speak.\n\nNetanyahu is convinced that he is not going to be forced to extend the settlement construction freeze, which is due to\nexpire in September. According to senior officials in Jerusalem, an agreement has already been reached with the\n\nadministration that the Israeli government will not announce an extension of the construction freeze in the territories,\nand the Americans will \"make sure\" that the Palestinians do not withdraw from the talks. Israel, however, will not take\n\n\"aggressive\" action and construction will be resumed only in areas that are clearly within the consensus inside the\nsettlement blocs.\n\nThe Prime Minister's Bureau vigorously denied the above report. \"The statements attributed to the prime minister are\nincorrect,\" said a spokesman in the Prime Minister's Bureau. \"They were not said by Netanyahu in any forum. The\n\nreason is simple: the prime minister does not think that, Prime Minister Netanyahu holds in great esteem the\ncommitment by President Obama and the administration to Israel's security and their efforts to renew the peace\n\nprocess in our region.\"\nEli Bardenstein adds: The formal invitation that Netanyahu received yesterday to meet with President Obama next week\n\nmight attest to a radical change in the White House's attitude towards him. Political sources in Israel described the\nplanned meeting as \"the peak of the campaign for Israel and the Jews that has been pursued by the Obama\n\nadministration in the past number of weeks.\" The sources said that the meeting was geared to put an end to the grave\ncrisis that erupted some two months ago between the Obama administration and Netanyahu over the Israeli-Palestinian\n\nconflict and particularly over the continued construction in East Jerusalem, and to mend the mistaken impression that\nwas received as if Israel was \"no longer an absolute ally of the United States.\"\n\nThat crisis, which was initiated by the Americans, elicited fierce criticism in the United States, and sparked a desire\namong members of the Obama administration to rectify the situation. Another reason for the administration's desire to\n\nend the crisis is the fear of failure in the upcoming Congressional elections in November. \"The Democratic Party's coffers\nare empty. Many Democrat members of Congress and Senators have complained that if the hazing of Israel were to\n\n continue, they would be unable to obtain donations from Jews and were liable to lose the elections,\" said one source in\n Washington.\n\n       <span class=\"unclassified\">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774925 Date: 08/31/2015</span>\n\nThe prevalent assessment is that Netanyahu will be received far more warmly in Washington next week than he was two\nmonths ago. This time the meeting will be covered by the media and the two leaders are expected to have their picture\n\ntaken together and to give statements to the media.\nThat said, sources in Washington noted that \"Netanyahu is leery of the meeting with Obama and of walking into a trap\n\nonce again. He knows that the smiles notwithstanding, behind closed doors he is going to have to give answers to very\ndifficult questions, like 'how do you envision the end of the negotiations with the Palestinians.\"\nNetanyahu is to begin his political travels today in Paris, where he is to attend the ceremony in honor of Israel's\n\nacceptance into the OECD. The prime minister will be arriving in a city that is on strike, which is liable to impede his\nmovement through the city streets to the center of Paris for his meetings.\n\t\t\t\t</div></div>",

A father and his daughter-\nstudent came to my office in a state of anxiety.\n\n         Some students are afraid to blog and post comments because they fear that they will be traced and that their\n parents will loose their jobs.\n\n       <span class=\"unclassified\">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774923 Date: 08/31/2015</span>\n\n        There is clear evidence from one of our banks that the authorities are beginning to dig into the question of our\nfinances.

KOUCHNER in Le Monde re Internet freedom\n</span>\n\nThe below by Kouchner is worth reading if you haven't seen it.\n\nThe Internet: a critical international policy issue, by Bernard Kouchner (May 10, 2010)\n\n In 2015, three and a half billion people - half of mankind - will have access to the Internet. There has never been such a\n revolution in the freedom of communication and the freedom of expression. But how will this new medium be used?\n\n What new distortions and obstacles will the enemies of the Internet come up with?\n\n Modern technology leads to the best and the worst. Extremist, racist and defamatory websites and blogs disseminate\n\n odious opinions in real time. They have made the Internet into a weapon of war and hate. Websites are attacked and\n Internet users are recruited through chatrooms for destructive plots. Violent movements are infiltrating social networks\n\n to spread propaganda and false information.\n\n It is very hard for democracies to control them. I do not subscribe to the naï¿½ve belief that a new technology, however\n efficient and powerful it may be, is bound by nature to advance liberty on all fronts.\n\n Yet, all the same, the distortions are the exception rather than the rule. The Internet is above all the most fantastic\n\n means of breaking down the walls and boundaries that close us off from each other. For the oppressed peoples, who\n have been deprived of their right to self-expression and the right to choose their own future, the Internet provides\n\n power beyond their wildest hopes. In minutes, news and images recorded on a telephone can be disseminated\n\n     <span class=\"unclassified\">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775744 Date: 08/31/2015</span>\n\nworldwide in cyberspace. It is increasingly difficult the hide a public demonstration, an act of repression or a violation of\nhuman rights.\n\nIn authoritarian and repressive countries, mobile telephones and the Internet have given rise to public opinion and civil\nsociety. They have also given citizens a critical means of expression, despite all the restrictions.\n\nHowever, the temptation to repress free expression is always present. The number of countries that censor the Internet,\nthat monitor web users and punish them for their opinions, is increasing at an alarming rate. The Internet can be used\n\nagainst citizens. It can be a formidable intelligence-gathering tool to spot potential dissidents. Some regimes are already\nacquiring increasingly sophisticated surveillance technology.\n\nIf all of those who are attached to human rights and democracy refused to compromise their principles and used the\nInternet to defend freedom of expression, this kind of repression would be much more difficult. I am not talking about\nabsolute freedom that opens the door to all sorts of abuses. Nobody is promoting that. Instead, I'm talking about real\n\nfreedom, which is based on the principle of respecting human dignity and human rights.\n\nIn the last few years, multilateral institutions, such as the Council of Europe, and non-governmental organisations, such\n\nas Reporters Without Borders, along with thousands of individuals around the world, have made a strong commitment\nto these issues. This is proof, if proof were needed, that this issue does not pit the West against the rest of the world. No\nfewer than 180 countries meeting for the World Summit on the Information Society acknowledged that the Universal\n\nDeclaration of Human Rights applies fully to the Internet, especially Article 19, which establishes freedom of expression\nand freedom of opinion. And yet, some fifty countries fail to live up to their commitments.\n\nFor the occasion of World Press Freedom Day, I have brought together experts, NGO leaders, journalists, business\npeople and intellectuals this week. Their discussions have confirmed my conviction that the path we want to take is the\nright one. I think that we should create an international instrument for monitoring the commitments that governments\n\nhave made and for calling them to task when they fail to live up to them. I think we should provide assistance to\ncyberdissidents, who should get the same support as other victims of political repression, and of the need to show our\nsolidarity with them publicly, in close collaboration with the NGOs working on these issues. I think that we should also\n\ndiscuss the wisdom of adopting a code of conduct regarding the export of technologies for censoring the Internet and\ntracking web users.\n\nThese issues, along with others, such as the protection of personal data on the Internet and the right of digital amnesty\nfor everyone promoted by my colleague Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, should be addressed within a framework that\nbrings together government, civil society and international experts.\n\nAnother project is close to my heart. It will be a long and difficult task to implement it, but it is critical. It is to give the\n Internet a legal status that reflects its universality. One that recognizes it as an international space, so that it will be\n\n more difficult for repressive governments to use the sovereignty argument against fundamental freedoms.\n\nThis is a critical issue. I think that the battle of ideas has started with, on one side, the advocates of a universal and open\n\n Internet, based on freedom of expression and freedom of association, on tolerance and respect for privacy and, on the\n other side, those who want to transform the Internet into a multitude of spaces that are closed off from each other to\nserve the purposes of a regime, propaganda and all forms of fanaticism.\n\n Freedom of expression is \"the foundation of all other freedoms\". Without it, there are no \"free nations\", Voltaire said.\n This spirit of the Enlightenment, which is universal, should run through the new media. The defence of fundamental\n\n freedoms and human rights must be the priority for governance of the Internet.

KOUCHNER in Le Monde re Internet freedom\n\n\nThe below by Kouchner is worth reading if you haven't seen it.\n\nThe Internet: a critical international policy issue, by Bernard Kouchner (May 10, 2010)\n\n In 2015, three and a half billion people - half of mankind - will have access to the Internet. There has never been such a\n revolution in the freedom of communication and the freedom of expression. But how will this new medium be used?\n\n What new distortions and obstacles will the enemies of the Internet come up with?\n\n Modern technology leads to the best and the worst. Extremist, racist and defamatory websites and blogs disseminate\n\n odious opinions in real time. They have made the Internet into a weapon of war and hate. Websites are attacked and\n Internet users are recruited through chatrooms for destructive plots. Violent movements are infiltrating social networks\n\n to spread propaganda and false information.\n\n It is very hard for democracies to control them. I do not subscribe to the naï¿½ve belief that a new technology, however\n efficient and powerful it may be, is bound by nature to advance liberty on all fronts.\n\n Yet, all the same, the distortions are the exception rather than the rule. The Internet is above all the most fantastic\n\n means of breaking down the walls and boundaries that close us off from each other. For the oppressed peoples, who\n have been deprived of their right to self-expression and the right to choose their own future, the Internet provides\n\n power beyond their wildest hopes. In minutes, news and images recorded on a telephone can be disseminated\n\n     UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775744 Date: 08/31/2015\n\nworldwide in cyberspace. It is increasingly difficult the hide a public demonstration, an act of repression or a violation of\nhuman rights.\n\nIn authoritarian and repressive countries, mobile telephones and the Internet have given rise to public opinion and civil\nsociety. They have also given citizens a critical means of expression, despite all the restrictions.\n\nHowever, the temptation to repress free expression is always present. The number of countries that censor the Internet,\nthat monitor web users and punish them for their opinions, is increasing at an alarming rate. The Internet can be used\n\nagainst citizens. It can be a formidable intelligence-gathering tool to spot potential dissidents. Some regimes are already\nacquiring increasingly sophisticated surveillance technology.\n\nIf all of those who are attached to human rights and democracy refused to compromise their principles and used the\nInternet to defend freedom of expression, this kind of repression would be much more difficult. I am not talking about\nabsolute freedom that opens the door to all sorts of abuses. Nobody is promoting that. Instead, I'm talking about real\n\nfreedom, which is based on the principle of respecting human dignity and human rights.\n\nIn the last few years, multilateral institutions, such as the Council of Europe, and non-governmental organisations, such\n\nas Reporters Without Borders, along with thousands of individuals around the world, have made a strong commitment\nto these issues. This is proof, if proof were needed, that this issue does not pit the West against the rest of the world. No\nfewer than 180 countries meeting for the World Summit on the Information Society acknowledged that the Universal\n\nDeclaration of Human Rights applies fully to the Internet, especially Article 19, which establishes freedom of expression\nand freedom of opinion. And yet, some fifty countries fail to live up to their commitments.\n\nFor the occasion of World Press Freedom Day, I have brought together experts, NGO leaders, journalists, business\npeople and intellectuals this week. Their discussions have confirmed my conviction that the path we want to take is the\nright one. I think that we should create an international instrument for monitoring the commitments that governments\n\nhave made and for calling them to task when they fail to live up to them. I think we should provide assistance to\ncyberdissidents, who should get the same support as other victims of political repression, and of the need to show our\nsolidarity with them publicly, in close collaboration with the NGOs working on these issues. I think that we should also\n\ndiscuss the wisdom of adopting a code of conduct regarding the export of technologies for censoring the Internet and\ntracking web users.\n\nThese issues, along with others, such as the protection of personal data on the Internet and the right of digital amnesty\nfor everyone promoted by my colleague Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, should be addressed within a framework that\nbrings together government, civil society and international experts.\n\nAnother project is close to my heart. It will be a long and difficult task to implement it, but it is critical. It is to give the\n Internet a legal status that reflects its universality. One that recognizes it as an international space, so that it will be\n\n more difficult for repressive governments to use the sovereignty argument against fundamental freedoms.\n\nThis is a critical issue. I think that the battle of ideas has started with, on one side, the advocates of a universal and open\n\n Internet, based on freedom of expression and freedom of association, on tolerance and respect for privacy and, on the\n other side, those who want to transform the Internet into a multitude of spaces that are closed off from each other to\nserve the purposes of a regime, propaganda and all forms of fanaticism.\n\n Freedom of expression is \"the foundation of all other freedoms\". Without it, there are no \"free nations\", Voltaire said.\n This spirit of the Enlightenment, which is universal, should run through the new media. The defence of fundamental\n\n freedoms and human rights must be the priority for governance of the Internet. It is everyone's business.\n\n Bernard Kouchner, Minister for Foreign and European Affairs\n\n   UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775744 Date: 08/31/2015\n\nThis email is UNCLASSIFIED.\n\t\t\t\t"

Berger\n\nSamuel R. Berger, chair of the global strategy firm Albright Stonebridge Group, served as national security advisor to\nPresident Clinton from 1997 to 2001.\n\n President Obama's National Security Strategy, released by the White House on Thursday, tackles a delicate but\n\nunavoidable question: How do we respond to new and old security challenges in an era of financial distress at home and\na reordering of political power abroad?\n\n For some time now, it has been clear that the definition of U.S. national security strategy needs rethinking. The\n\nSeptember 11 attacks, global economic crisis, cyber-terror threats and even the environmental catastrophe in the Gulf\n underscore that the challenges America faces in 2010 have changed even from just a decade ago. And while America's\n\n military supremacy is certainly not at risk, new international arrangements - such as the shift from the G-7 club of\n powerful nations to the G-20, which incorporates emerging nations from China to Brazil - are needed so that the costs\n\n and benefits of a stable international order are shared. The United States cannot solve most global threats without\n others, nor should we bear the burden alone.\n\n Enter the National Security Strategy. In my experience, these congressionally mandated documents can easily become\n\n laborious and impenetrable, or mere compendiums of bureaucratic pleading from various parts of the government.\n\n (Make sure you do right by Japan! Don't step on the Pentagon!) The challenge, which President Clinton insisted upon to\n me and his other advisers, is to provide a strategic framework that is clarifying to the rest of the world and informs\n\n       <span class=\"unclassified\">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776078 Date: 08/31/2015</span>\n\nadministration decision makers up and down the line. It's not a blueprint for action, but a means to convey the\n\npresident's principles and priorities.\n\nIn Obama's case, the new sober and comprehensive 52-page strategy incorporates the new realities and breaks with\npast strategies in several key respects. But it also reflects an understanding that we face enduring challenges - nuclear\n\nproliferation, terrorism and regional conflicts - for which the best response is a return to fundamentals.\n\nOne such fundamental is the strength of our economy. At a time when the after-effects of a financial crisis and the fiscal\n\nburden of two long wars have raised fears of an overextended America, the administration makes a case for economic\nand technological renewal as a crucial underpinning of U.S. security. The president made this case in his West Point\n\nspeech last weekend. \"At no time in human history,\" he said, \"has a nation of diminished economic vitality maintained\nits military and political primacy.\"\n\nAnother fundamental challenge is arms control and nuclear proliferation. By seeking strategic arms cuts with Russia, the\npresident has returned to a long bipartisan tradition that languished during the prior administration. And by convening a\n\nglobal summit on securing nuclear material this spring, Obama has given new urgency and global purchase to the effort\nstarted in 1991 when Sens. Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar first initiated a program to lock down nuclear materials.\n\nOn terrorism, the strategy builds on the past, but breaks with it as well. Presidents Clinton, Bush and Obama each have\n\ndeployed all of America's tools: military power, homeland defense, law enforcement, sanctions, intelligence and\nvigorous efforts to cut off terrorist financing. But the critical difference in the Obama strategy is that it rejects the Global\n\nWar on Terror lens through which the prior administration viewed the challenge. \"This is not a global war against a tactic\n- terrorism - or a religion - Islam,\" the new strategy says. \"We are at war with a specific network, al-Qaeda and its\n\nterrorist affiliates.\"\n\nThis sharper focus avoids alienating many in the Muslim world, ensures the support of key allies who never accepted the\n\n broader construct and avoids the overreactions that led us to forsake the fight against aI-Qaeda fight in Afghanistan and\n turn our efforts to the unrelated threat from Saddam Hussein's Iraq.\n\n In perhaps the most dramatic departure from the strategy of its predecessor, the Obama administration has restored a\n less provocative policy on the use of military force. In the 2002 national security strategy, President Bush articulated the\n\n rationale for preemptive war just weeks before seeking a U.N. resolution to invade Iraq. The new strategy restores the\n principles that have guided administrations for decades: the use of force should be a last resort, should weigh all the\n\n costs and benefits, and should have as much international support as possible. The administration reserves the right to\n act unilaterally - for example against al-Qaeda and its allies - but resurrects the principle President Clinton often\n\n described as \"together where possible, alone where necessary.\"\n\n President Obama's critics have focused on his diplomatic engagement with hostile states like Iran and North Korea. The\n\n President sets forth his rationale: \"to create opportunities to resolve differences, strengthen the international\n community's support for our actions, learn about the intentions and nature of closed regimes, and plainly demonstrate\n\n to the public within those nations that their governments are to blame for their isolation.\"\n In the case of Iran, Washington's outstretched hand has not resulted in Iran's compliance. But attempts to engage have\n\n helped ensure that the world's attention is focused on Iran's intransigence rather than Washington's refusal to\n negotiate.\n\n      <span class=\"unclassified\">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776078 Date: 08/31/2015</span>\n\nWithout a doubt, there are gaps between principle and practice. Despite the Obama administration's stated goal of\ndoubling exports in the next five years, it has not put its muscle behind trade agreements with South Korea, Panama and\n\nColombia. And the clarity of its call to respect human rights has at times been muted in the face of tough realities.\n\nSixteen months into this administration there has been much progress, but many of the true tests of this strategy lie\nahead.\n\nIn the strategy's conclusions, the Obama administration evokes an even earlier era, calling for both political parties to\nrestore the cooperation and common purpose so crucial to our success during the dark days of the Cold War. Despite\n\nthe intense debates at the time over nuclear arms control, Central America and dï¿½tente, nearly all American supported\nthe containment of communism.\n\nIn that same spirit, the administration's framework deserves broad bipartisan support. We can and should argue out our\ndifferences over detention of prisoners, methods to disarm dangerous states, how hard to push for democratic rights, or\n\nthe costs of climate change legislation. But at the same time, we can rally around the overriding U.S. foreign policy goals\nspelled out in the strategy: renewing our economy at home to ensure leadership abroad; defeating al-Qaeda; succeeding\n\nin Afghanistan; preventing nuclear proliferation; curbing climate change; and promoting an international order of\nenlightened self-interest, economic prosperity and the fundamental values upon which America is based.\n\t\t\t\t</div></div>",

We did not make\nconcessions on our red lines and they failed to make us fold and to drag us to places we didn't want to go, said\n\nNetanyahu, according to people who heard him speak.\nNetanyahu is convinced that he is not going to be forced to extend the settlement construction freeze, which is due to\n\nexpire in September. According to senior officials in Jerusalem, an agreement has already been reached with the\nadministration that the Israeli government will not announce an extension of the construction freeze in the territories,\n\nand the Americans will \"make sure\" that the Palestinians do not withdraw from the talks. Israel, however, will not take\n\"aggressive\" action and construction will be resumed only in areas that are clearly within the consensus inside the\n\nsettlement blocs.\nThe Prime Minister's Bureau vigorously denied the above report. \"The statements attributed to the prime minister are\n\nincorrect,\" said a spokesman in the Prime Minister's Bureau. \"They were not said by Netanyahu in any forum. The\n reason is simple: the prime minister does not think that, Prime Minister Netanyahu holds in great esteem the\n\ncommitment by President Obama and the administration to Israel's security and their efforts to renew the peace\n process in our region.\"\n Eli Bardenstein adds: The formal invitation that Netanyahu received yesterday to meet with President Obama next week\n\n might attest to a radical change in the White House's attitude towards him. Political sources in Israel described the\n planned meeting as \"the peak of the campaign for Israel and the Jews that has been pursued by the Obama\n\n administration in the past number of weeks.\" The sources said that the meeting was geared to put an end to the grave\n crisis that erupted some two months ago between the Obama administration and Netanyahu over the Israeli-Palestinian\n\n conflict and particularly over the continued construction in East Jerusalem, and to mend the mistaken impression that\n was received as if Israel was \"no longer an absolute ally of the United States.\"\n\n That crisis, which was initiated by the Americans, elicited fierce criticism in the United States, and sparked a desire\n among members of the Obama administration to rectify the situation. Another reason for the administration's desire to ï¿½\n\n end the crisis is the fear of failure in the upcoming Congressional elections in November. \"The Democratic Party's coffers\n are empty.

We did not make\nconcessions on our red lines and they failed to make us fold and to drag us to places we didn't want to go, said\n\nNetanyahu, according to people who heard him speak.\nNetanyahu is convinced that he is not going to be forced to extend the settlement construction freeze, which is due to\n\nexpire in September. According to senior officials in Jerusalem, an agreement has already been reached with the\nadministration that the Israeli government will not announce an extension of the construction freeze in the territories,\n\nand the Americans will \"make sure\" that the Palestinians do not withdraw from the talks. Israel, however, will not take\n\"aggressive\" action and construction will be resumed only in areas that are clearly within the consensus inside the\n\nsettlement blocs.\nThe Prime Minister's Bureau vigorously denied the above report. \"The statements attributed to the prime minister are\n\nincorrect,\" said a spokesman in the Prime Minister's Bureau. \"They were not said by Netanyahu in any forum. The\n reason is simple: the prime minister does not think that, Prime Minister Netanyahu holds in great esteem the\n\ncommitment by President Obama and the administration to Israel's security and their efforts to renew the peace\n process in our region.\"\n Eli Bardenstein adds: The formal invitation that Netanyahu received yesterday to meet with President Obama next week\n\n might attest to a radical change in the White House's attitude towards him. Political sources in Israel described the\n planned meeting as \"the peak of the campaign for Israel and the Jews that has been pursued by the Obama\n\n administration in the past number of weeks.\" The sources said that the meeting was geared to put an end to the grave\n crisis that erupted some two months ago between the Obama administration and Netanyahu over the Israeli-Palestinian\n\n conflict and particularly over the continued construction in East Jerusalem, and to mend the mistaken impression that\n was received as if Israel was \"no longer an absolute ally of the United States.\"\n\n That crisis, which was initiated by the Americans, elicited fierce criticism in the United States, and sparked a desire\n among members of the Obama administration to rectify the situation. Another reason for the administration's desire to ï¿½\n\n end the crisis is the fear of failure in the upcoming Congressional elections in November. \"The Democratic Party's coffers\n are empty. Many Democrat members of Congress and Senators have complained that if the hazing of Israel were to\n\n continue, they would be unable to obtain donations from Jews and were liable to lose the elections,\" said one source in\n Washington.\n\n      UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776099 Date: 08/31/2015\n\nThe prevalent assessment is that Netanyahu will be received far more warmly in Washington next week than he was two\nmonths ago. This time the meeting will be covered by the media and the two leaders are expected to have their picture\ntaken together and to give statements to the media.\n\nThat said, sources in Washington noted that \"Netanyahu is leery of the meeting with Obama and of walking into a trap\nonce again.

Nonetheless, the article below, just posted by the NY\nReview, soon to be published, is a breakthrough piece that will have a large impact.

In response, he unwittingly produced the most damning indictment of the organized American Jewish\n community that I have ever seen.\n\n The philanthropists wanted to know what Jewish students thought about Israel. Luntz found that they mostly didn't. \"Six\n times we have brought Jewish youth together as a group to talk about their Jewishness and connection to Israel,\" he\n\n reported. \"Six times the topic of Israel did not come up until it was prompted. Six times these Jewish youth used the\n word 'they' rather than `us' to describe the situation.\"\n\n That Luntz encountered indifference was not surprising. In recent years, several studies have revealed, in the words of\n Steven Cohen of Hebrew Union College and Ari Kelman of the University of California at bavis, that \"non-Orthodox\n\n younger Jews, on the whole, feel much less attached to Israel than their elders,\" with many professing \"a near-total\n absence of positive feelings.\" In 2008, the student senate at Brandeis, the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored university\n\n in America, rejected a resolution commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the Jewish state.\n\n        <span class=\"unclassified\">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775710 Date: 08/31/2015</span>\n\nLuntz's task was to figure out what had gone wrong. When he probed the students' views of Israel, he hit up against\nsome firm beliefs. First, \"they reserve the right to question the Israeli position.\" These young Jews, Luntz explained,\n\n\"resist anything they see as 'group think.\" They want an \"open and frank\" discussion of Israel and its flaws. Second,\n\"young Jews desperately want peace.\" When Luntz showed them a series of ads, one of the most popular was entitled\n\n\"Proof that Israel Wants Peace,\" and listed offers by various Israeli governments to withdraw from conquered land.\nThird, \"some empathize with the plight of the Palestinians.\" When Luntz displayed ads depicting Palestinians as violent\n\nand hateful, several focus group participants criticized them as stereotypical and unfair, citing their own Muslim friends.\nMost of the students, in other words, were liberals, broadly defined. They had imbibed some of the defining values of\n\nAmerican Jewish political culture: a belief in open debate, a skepticism about military force, a commitment to human\n\nrights. And in their innocence, they did not realize that they were supposed to shed those values when it came to Israel.\nThe only kind of Zionism they found attractive was a Zionism that recognized Palestinians as deserving of dignity and\n\ncapable of peace, and they were quite willing to condemn an Israeli government that did not share those beliefs. Luntz\ndid not grasp the irony. The only kind of Zionism they found attractive was the kind that the American Jewish\n\nestablishment has been working against for most of their lives.\nAmong American Jews today, there are a great many Zionists, especially in the Orthodox world, people deeply devoted\n\nto the State of Israel. And there are a great many liberals, especially in the secular Jewish world, people deeply devoted\nto human rights for all people, Palestinians included. But the two groups are increasingly distinct. Particularly in the\n\nyounger generations, fewer and fewer American Jewish liberals are Zionists; fewer and fewer American Jewish Zionists\nare liberal. One reason is that the leading institutions of American Jewry have refused to fosterï¿½indeed, have actively\n\nopposedï¿½a Zionism that challenges Israel's behavior in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and toward its own Arab citizens.\nFor several decades, the Jewish establishment has asked American Jews to check their liberalism at Zionism's door, and\n\nnow, to their horror, they are finding that many young Jews have checked their Zionism instead.\nMorally, American Zionism is in a downward spiral. If the leaders of groups like AIPAC and the Conference of Presidents\n\nof Major American Jewish Organizations do not change course, they will wake up one day to find a younger, Orthodox-\ndominated, Zionist leadership whose naked hostility to Arabs and Palestinians scares even them, and a mass of secular\n\nAmerican Jews who range from apathetic to appalled. Saving liberal Zionism in the United Statesï¿½so that American\nJews can help save liberal Zionism in Israelï¿½is the great American Jewish challenge of our age. And it starts where\n\n Luntz's students wanted it to start: by talking frankly about Israel's current government, by no longer averting our eyes.\nSince the 1990s, journalists and scholars have been describing a bifurcation in Israeli society. In the words of Hebrew\n\n University political scientist Yaron Ezrahi, \"After decades of what came to be called a national consensus, the Zionist\n narrative of liberation [has] dissolved into openly contesting versions.\" One version, \"founded on a long memory of\n\n persecution, genocide, and a bitter struggle for survival, is pessimistic, distrustful of non-Jews, and believing only in\nJewish power and solidarity.\" Another, \"nourished by secularized versions of messianism as well as the Enlightenment\n\n idea of progress,\" articulates \"a deep sense of the limits of military force, and a commitment to liberal-democratic\n values.\" Every country manifests some kind of ideological divide. But in contemporary Israel, the gulf is among the\n\n widest on earth.\n As Ezrahi and others have noted, this latter, liberal-democratic Zionism has grown alongside a new individualism,\n\n particularly among secular Israelis, a greater demand for free expression, and a greater skepticism of coercive authority.\n You can see this spirit in \"new historians\" like Tom Segev who have fearlessly excavated the darker corners of the Zionist\n\n past and in jurists like former Supreme Court President Aharon Barak who have overturned Knesset laws that violate the\n human rights guarantees in Israel's \"Basic Laws.\" You can also see it in former Prime Minister Ehud Barak's apparent\n\n willingness to relinquish much of the West Bank in 2000 and early 2001.\n But in Israel today, this humane, universalistic Zionism does not wield power. To the contrary, it is gasping for air. To\n\n understand how deeply antithetical its values are to those of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, it's\n worth considering the case of Effi Eitam. Eitam, a charismatic exï¿½cabinet minister and war hero, has proposed ethnically\n\n cleansing Palestinians from the West Bank. \"We'll have to expel the overwhelming majority of West Bank Arabs from\n here and remove Israeli Arabs from [the] political system,\" he declared in 2006. In 2008, Eitam merged his small Ahi\n\n Party into Netanyahu's Likud. And for the 2009-2010 academic year, he is Netanyahu's special emissary for overseas\n \"campus engagement.\" In that capacity, he visited a dozen American high schools and colleges last fall on the Israeli\n\n government's behalf. The group that organized his tour was called \"Caravan for Democracy.\"\n Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman once shared Eitam's views. In his youth, he briefly joined Meir Kahane's now\n\n banned Kach Party, which also advocated the expulsion of Arabs from Israeli soil. Now Lieberman's position might be\n called \"pre-expulsion.\" He wants to revoke the citizenship of Israeli Arabs who won't swear a loyalty oath to the Jewish\n\n        <span class=\"unclassified\">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775710 Date: 08/31/2015</span>\n\nstate. He tried to prevent two Arab parties that opposed Israel's 2008-2009 Gaza war from running candidates for the\nKnesset. He said Arab Knesset members who met with representatives of Hamas should be executed. He wants to jail\n\nArabs who publicly mourn on Israeli Independence Day, and he hopes to permanently deny citizenship to Arabs from\nother countries who marry Arab citizens of Israel.\n\nYou don't have to be paranoid to see the connection between Lieberman's current views and his former ones. The more\nyou strip Israeli Arabs of legal protection, and the more you accuse them of treason, the more thinkable a policy of\n\nexpulsion becomes. Lieberman's American defenders often note that in theory he supports a Palestinian state. What\nthey usually fail to mention is that for him, a two-state solution means redrawing Israel's border so that a large chunk of\n\nIsraeli Arabs find themselves exiled to another country, without their consent.\nLieberman served as chief of staff during Netanyahu's first term as prime minister. And when it comes to the West Bank,\n\nNetanyahu's own record is in its way even more extreme than his protï¿½gï¿½'s. In his 1993 book, A Place among the\nNations, Netanyahu not only rejects the idea of a Palestinian state, he denies that there is such a thing as a Palestinian.\n\nIn fact, he repeatedly equates the Palestinian bid for statehood with Nazism. An Israel that withdraws from the West\nBank, he has declared, would be a \"ghetto-state\" with \"Auschwitz borders.\" And the effort \"to gouge Judea and Samaria\n\n[the West Bank] out of Israel\" resembles Hitler's bid to wrench the German-speaking \"Sudeten district\" from\nCzechoslovakia in 1938. It is unfair, Netanyahu insists, to ask Israel to concede more territory since it has already made\n\nvast, gut-wrenching concessions. What kind of concessions? It has abandoned its claim to Jordan, which by rights should\nbe part of the Jewish state.\n\nOn the left of Netanyahu's coalition sits Ehud Barak's emasculated Labor Party, but whatever moderating potential it\nmay have is counterbalanced by what is, in some ways, the most illiberal coalition partner of all, Shas, the ultra-\n\nOrthodox party representing Jews of North African and Middle Eastern descent. At one point, Shasï¿½like some of its\nAshkenazi ultra-Orthodox counterpartsï¿½was open to dismantling settlements. In recent years, however, ultra-Orthodox            .\n\nIsraelis, anxious to find housing for their large families, have increasingly moved to the West Bank, where thanks to\ngovernment subsidies it is far cheaper to live. Not coincidentally, their political parties have swung hard against\n\nterritorial compromise. And they have done so with a virulence that reflects ultra-Orthodox Judaism's profound hostility\nto liberal values. Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, Shas's immensely powerful spiritual leader, has called Arabs \"vipers,\" \"snakes,\"\n\nand \"ants.\" In 2005, after Prime Minister Ariel Sharon proposed dismantling settlements in the Gaza Strip, Yosef urged\nthat \"God strike him down.\" The official Shas newspaper recently called President Obama \"an Islamic extremist.\"\n\nHebrew University Professor Ze'ev Sternhell is an expert on fascism and a winner of the prestigious Israel Prize.\nCommenting on Lieberman and the leaders of Shas in a recent Op-Ed in Haaretz, he wrote, \"The last time politicians\n\nholding views similar to theirs were in power in postï¿½World War II Western Europe was in Franco's Spain.\" With their\nblessing, \"a crude and multifaceted campaign is being waged against the foundations of the democratic and liberal\n\norder.\" Sternhell should know. In September 2008, he was injured when a settler set off a pipe bomb at his house.\n Israeli governments come and go, but the Netanyahu coalition is the product of frightening, long-term trends in Israeli\n\nsociety: an ultra-Orthodox population that is increasing dramatically, a settler movement that is growing more radical\nand more entrenched in the Israeli bureaucracy and army, and a Russian immigrant community that is particularly prone\n\nto anti-Arab racism. In 2009, a poll by the Israel Democracy Institute found that 53 percent of Jewish Israelis (and 77\n percent of recent immigrants from the former USSR) support encouraging Arabs to leave the country. Attitudes are\n\n worst among Israel's young. When Israeli high schools held mock elections last year, Lieberman won. This March, a poll\nfound that 56 percent of Jewish Israeli high school studentsï¿½and more than 80 percent of religious Jewish high school\n\nstudentsï¿½would deny Israeli Arabs the right to be elected to the Knesset. An education ministry official called the\n survey \"a huge warning signal in light of the strengthening trends of extremist views among the youth.\"\n\n You might think that such trends, and the sympathy for them expressed by some in Israel's government, would occasion\n substantial public concernï¿½even outrageï¿½among the leaders of organized American Jewry. You would be wrong. In\n\n Israel itself, voices from the left, and even center, warn in increasingly urgent tones about threats to Israeli democracy.\n (Former Prime Ministers Ehud Olmert and Ehud Barak have both said that Israel risks becoming an \"apartheid state\" if it\n\n continues to hold the West Bank. This April, when settlers forced a large Israeli bookstore to stop selling a book critical\n of the occupation, Shulamit Aloni, former head of the dovish Meretz Party, declared that \"Israel has not been\n\n democratic for some time now.\") But in the United States, groups like AIPAC and the Presidents' Conference patrol\n public discourse, scolding people who contradict their vision of Israel as a state in which all leaders cherish democracy\n\n and yearn for peace.\n The result is a terrible irony. In theory, mainstream American Jewish organizations still hew to a liberal vision of Zionism.\n\n On its website, AIPAC celebrates Israel's commitment to \"free speech and minority rights.\" The Conference of Presidents\n\n       <span class=\"unclassified\">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775710 Date: 08/31/2015</span>\n\ndeclares that \"Israel and the United States share political, moral and intellectual values including democracy, freedom,\nsecurity and peace.\" These groups would never say, as do some in Netanyahu's coalition, that Israeli Arabs don't deserve\n\nfull citizenship and West Bank Palestinians don't deserve human rights. But in practice, by defending virtually anything\nany Israeli government does, they make themselves intellectual bodyguards for Israeli leaders who threaten the very\n\nliberal values they profess to admire.\nAfter Israel's elections last February, for instance, Malcolm Hoenlein, executive vice-chairman of the Presidents'\n\nConference, explained that Avigdor Lieberman's agenda was \"far more moderate than the media has presented it.\"\nInsisting that Lieberman bears no general animus toward Israeli Arabs, Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-\n\nDefamation League, told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency that \"He's not saying expel them. He's not saying punish them.\"\n(Permanently denying citizenship to their Arab spouses or jailing them if they publicly mourn on Israeli Independence\n\nDay evidently does not qualify as punishment.) The ADL has criticized anti-Arab bigotry in the past, and the American\nJewish Committee, to its credit, warned that Lieberman's proposed loyalty oath would \"chill Israel's democratic political\n\ndebate.\" But the Forward summed up the overall response of America's communal Jewish leadership in its headline\n\n\"Jewish Leaders Largely Silent on Lieberman's Role in Government.\"\n\nNot only does the organized American Jewish community mostly avoid public criticism of the Israeli government, it tries\nto prevent others from leveling such criticism as well. In recent years, American Jewish organizations have waged a\n\ncampaign to discredit the world's most respected international human rights groups. In 2006, Foxman called an Amnesty\nInternational report on Israeli killing of Lebanese civilians \"bigoted, biased, and borderline anti-Semitic.\" The Conference\n\nof Presidents has announced that \"biased NGOs include Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Christian Aid,\n[and] Save the Children.\" Last summer, an AIPAC spokesman declared that Human Rights Watch \"has repeatedly\n\ndemonstrated its anti-Israel bias.\" When the Obama administration awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Mary\nRobinson, former UN high commissioner for human rights, the ADL and AIPAC both protested, citing the fact that she\n\nhad presided over the 2001 World Conference Against Racism in Durban, South Africa. (Early drafts of the conference\nreport implicitly accused Israel of racism. Robinson helped expunge that defamatory charge, angering Syria and Iran.)\n\n Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International are not infallible. But when groups like AIPAC and the Presidents'\nConference avoid virtually all public criticism of Israeli actionsï¿½directing their outrage solely at Israel's neighborsï¿½they\n\n leave themselves in a poor position to charge bias. Moreover, while American Jewish groups claim that they are simply\ndefending Israel from its foes, they are actually taking sides in a struggle within Israel between radically different Zionist\n\nvisions. At the very moment the Anti-Defamation League claimed that Robinson harbored an \"animus toward Israel,\" an\nalliance of seven Israeli human rights groups publicly congratulated her on her award. Many of those groups, like\n\n B'Tselem, which monitors Israeli actions in the Occupied Territories, and the Israeli branch of Physicians for Human\n Rights, have been at least as critical of Israel's actions in Lebanon, Gaza, and the West Bank as have Amnesty\n\n International and Human Rights Watch.\n All of which raises an uncomfortable question. If American Jewish groups claim that Israel's overseas human rights critics\n\n are motivated by anti- Israeli, if not anti-Semitic, bias, what does that say about Israel's domestic human rights critics?\n The implication is clear: they must be guilty of self-hatred, if not treason. American Jewish leaders don't generally say\n\n that, of course, but their allies in the Netanyahu government do. Last summer, Israel's vice prime minister, Moshe\n Ya'alon, called the anti-occupation group Peace Now a \"virus.\" This January, a right-wing group called Im Tirtzu accused\n\n Israeli human rights organizations of having fed information to the Goldstone Commission that investigated Israel's Gaza\n war. A Knesset member from Netanyahu's Likud promptly charged Naomi Chazan, head of the New Israel Fund, which\n\n supports some of those human rights groups, with treason, and a member of Lieberman's party launched an\n investigation aimed at curbing foreign funding of Israeli NGOs.\n\n To their credit, Foxman and other American Jewish leaders opposed the move, which might have impaired their own\n work. But they are reaping what they sowed. If you suggest that mainstream human rights criticism of Israel's\n\n government is motivated by animus toward the state, or toward Jews in general, you give aid and comfort to those in\n Israel who make the same charges against the human rights critics in their midst.\n\n In the American Jewish establishment today, the language of liberal Zionismï¿½with its idioms of human rights, equal\n citizenship, and territorial compromiseï¿½has been drained of meaning. It remains the lingua franca in part for\n\n generational reasons, because many older American Zionists still see themselves as liberals of a sort. They vote\n Democratic; they are unmoved by biblical claims to the West Bank; they see average Palestinians as decent people\n\n betrayed by bad leaders; and they are secular. They don't want Jewish organizations to criticize Israel from the left, but\n neither do they want them to be agents of the Israeli right.\n\n       <span class=\"unclassified\">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775710 Date: 08/31/2015</span>\n\nThese American Zionists are largely the product of a particular era. Many were shaped by the terrifying days leading up\nto the Six-Day War, when it appeared that Israel might be overrun, and by the bitter aftermath of the Yom Kippur War,\n\nwhen much of the world seemed to turn against the Jewish state. In that crucible, Israel became their Jewish identity,\noften in conjunction with the Holocaust, which the 1967 and 1973 wars helped make central to American Jewish life.\n\nThese Jews embraced Zionism before the settler movement became a major force in Israeli politics, before the 1982\nLebanon war, before the first intifada. They fell in love with an Israel that was more secular, less divided, and less shaped\n\nby the culture, politics, and theology of occupation. And by downplaying the significance of Avigdor Lieberman, the\nsettlers, and Shas, American Jewish groups allow these older Zionists to continue to identify with that more internally\n\ncohesive, more innocent Israel of their youth, an Israel that now only exists in their memories.\nBut these secular Zionists aren't reproducing themselves. Their children have no memory of Arab armies massed on\n\nIsrael's border and of Israel surviving in part thanks to urgent military assistance from the United States. Instead, they\nhave grown up viewing Israel as a regional hegemon and an occupying power. As a result, they are more conscious than\n\ntheir parents of the degree to which Israeli behavior violates liberal ideals, and less willing to grant Israel an exemption\nbecause its survival seems in peril. Because they have inherited their parents' liberalism, they cannot embrace their\n\nuncritical Zionism. Because their liberalism is real, they can see that the liberalism of the American Jewish establishment\nis fake.\n\nTo sustain their uncritical brand of Zionism, therefore, America's Jewish organizations will need to look elsewhere to\nreplenish their ranks. They will need to find young American Jews who have come of age during the West Bank\n\noccupation but are not troubled by it. And those young American Jews will come disproportionately from the Orthodox\nworld.\n\nBecause they marry earlier, intermarry less, and have more children, Orthodox Jews are growing rapidly as a share of\nthe American Jewish population. According to a 2006 American Jewish Committee (AJC) survey, while Orthodox Jews\n\nmake up only 12 percent of American Jewry over the age of sixty, they constitute 34 percent between the ages of\neighteen and twenty-four. For America's Zionist organizations, these Orthodox youngsters are a potential bonanza. In\n\ntheir yeshivas they learn devotion to Israel from an early age; they generally spend a year of religious study there after\nhigh school, and often know friends or relatives who have immigrated to Israel. The same AJC study found that while\n\nonly 16 percent of non-Orthodox adult Jews under the age of forty feel \"very close to Israel,\" among the Orthodox the\nfigure is 79 percent. As secular Jews drift away from America's Zionist institutions, their Orthodox counterparts will likely\n\nstep into the breach. The Orthodox \"are still interested in parochial Jewish concerns,\" explains Samuel Heilman, a\nsociologist at the City University of New York. \"They are among the last ones who stayed in the Jewish house, so they\n\nnow control the lights.\"\nBut it is this very parochialismï¿½a deep commitment to Jewish concerns, which often outweighs more universal onesï¿½\n\nthat gives Orthodox Jewish Zionism a distinctly illiberal cast. The 2006 AJC poll found that while 60 percent of non-\nOrthodox American Jews under the age of forty support a Palestinian state, that figure drops to 25 percent among the\n\nOrthodox. In 2009, when Brandeis University's Theodore Sasson asked American Jewish focus groups about Israel, he\nfound Orthodox participants much less supportive of dismantling settlements as part of a peace deal. Even more\n\ntellingly, Reform, Conservative, and unaffiliated Jews tended to believe that average Palestinians wanted peace, but had\n been ill-served by their leaders. Orthodox Jews, by contrast, were more likely to see the Palestinian people as the\n\nenemy, and to deny that ordinary Palestinians shared any common interests or values with ordinary Israelis or Jews.\nOrthodox Judaism has great virtues, including a communal warmth and a commitment to Jewish learning unmatched in\n\nthe American Jewish world. (I'm biased, since my family attends an Orthodox synagogue.) But if current trends continue,\nthe growing influence of Orthodox Jews in America's Jewish communal institutions will erode even the liberal-\n\ndemocratic veneer that today covers American Zionism. In 2002, America's major Jewish organizations sponsored a large\n Israel solidarity rally on the Washington Mall. Up and down the east coast, yeshivas shut down for the day, swelling the\n\nestimated Orthodox share of the crowd to close to 70 percent. When the then Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul\n Wolfowitz told the rally that \"innocent Palestinians are suffering and dying as well,\" he was booed.\n\n America's Jewish leaders should think hard about that rally. Unless they change course, it portends the future: an\n American Zionist movement that does not even feign concern for Palestinian dignity and a broader American Jewish\n\n population that does not even feign concern for Israel. My own children, given their upbringing, could as easily end up\n\n among the booers as among Luntz's focus group. Either prospect fills me with dread.\n In 2004, in an effort to prevent weapons smuggling from Egypt, Israeli tanks and bulldozers demolished hundreds of\n\n houses in the Rafah refugee camp in the southern Gaza Strip. Watching television, a veteran Israeli commentator and\n\n        <span class=\"unclassified\">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775710 Date: 08/31/2015</span>\n\n'politician named Tommy Lapid saw an elderly Palestinian woman crouched on all fours looking for her medicines amid\n the ruins of her home. He said she reminded him of his grandmother.\n\n In that moment, Lapid captured the spirit that is suffocating within organized American Jewish life. To begin with, he\n watched. In my experience, there is an epidemic of not watching among American Zionists today. A Red Cross study on\n\n malnutrition in the Gaza Strip, a bill in the Knesset to allow Jewish neighborhoods to bar entry to Israeli Arabs, an Israeli\n human rights report on settlers burning Palestinian olive groves, three more Palestinian teenagers shotï¿½it's unpleasant.\n\n Rationalizing and minimizing Palestinian suffering has become a kind of game. In a more recent report on how to foster\n Zionism among America's young, Luntz urges American Jewish groups to use the word \"Arabs, not Palestinians,\" since\n\n \"the term 'Palestinians' evokes images of refugee camps, victims and oppression,\" while \"Arab' says wealth, oil and\n Islam./7\n\n Of course, Israelï¿½like the United Statesï¿½must sometimes take morally difficult actions in its own defense. But they are\n morally difficult only if you allow yourself some human connection to the other side. Otherwise, security justifies\n\n everything. The heads of AIPAC and the Presidents' Conference should ask themselves what Israel's leaders would have\n to do or say to make them scream \"no.\" After all, Lieberman is foreign minister; Effi Eitam is touring American\n\n universities; settlements are growing at triple the rate of the Israeli population; half of Israeli Jewish high school\n students want Arabs barred from the Knesset. If the line has not yet been crossed, where is the line?\n\n What infuriated critics about Lapid's comment was that his grandmother died at Auschwitz. How dare he defile the\n memory of the Holocaust? Of course, the Holocaust is immeasurably worse than anything Israel has done or ever will\n\n do. But at least Lapid used Jewish suffering to connect to the suffering of others. In the world of AIPAC, the Holocaust\n analogies never stop, and their message is always the same: Jews are licensed by their victimhood to worry only about\n\n themselves. Many of Israel's founders believed that with statehood, Jews would rightly be judged on the way they\n treated the non-Jews living under their dominion. \"For the first time we shall be the majority living with a minority,\"\n\n Knesset member Pinchas Lavon declared in 1948, \"and we shall be called upon to provide an example and prove how\n Jews live with a minority.\"\n\n But the message of the American Jewish establishment and its allies in the Netanyahu government is exactly the\n opposite: since Jews are history's permanent victims, always on the knife-edge of extinction, moral responsibility is a\n\n luxury Israel does not have. Its only responsibility is to survive. As former Knesset speaker Avraham Burg writes in his\n remarkable 2008 book, The Holocaust Is Over; We Must Rise From Its Ashes, \"Victimhood sets you free.\"\n\n This obsession with victimhood lies at the heart of why Zionism is dying among America's secular Jewish young. It simply\n bears no relationship to their lived experience, or what they have seen of Israel's. Yes, Israel faces threats from\n\n Hezbollah and Hamas. Yes, Israelis understandably worry about a nuclear Iran. But the dilemmas you face when you\n possess dozens or hundreds of nuclear weapons, and your adversary, however despicable, may acquire one, are not the\n\n dilemmas of the Warsaw Ghetto. The year 2010 is not, as Benjamin Netanyahu has claimed, 1938. The drama of Jewish\n victimhoodï¿½a drama that feels natural to many Jews who lived through 1938, 1948, or even 1967ï¿½strikes most of\n\n today's young American Jews as farce.\n But there is a different Zionist calling, which has never been more desperately relevant. It has its roots in Israel's\n\n Independence Proclamation, which promised that the Jewish state \"will be based on the precepts of liberty, justice and\n peace taught by the Hebrew prophets,\" and in the December 1948 letter from Albert Einstein, Hannah Arendt, and\n\n others to The New York Times, protesting right-wing Zionist leader Menachem Begin's visit to the United States after his\n party's militias massacred Arab civilians in the village of Deir Yassin. It is a call to recognize that in a world in which\n\n Jewish fortunes haveï¿½radically changed, the best way to memorialize the history of Jewish suffering is through the\n ethical use of Jewish power.\n\n For several months now, a group of Israeli students has been traveling every Friday to the East Jerusalem neighborhood\n of Sheikh Jarrah, where a Palestinian family named the Ghawis lives on the street outside their home of fifty-three years,\n\n from which they were evicted to make room for Jewish settlers. Although repeatedly arrested for protesting without a\n permit, and called traitors and self-haters by the Israeli right, the students keep coming, their numbers now swelling into\n\n the thousands. What if American Jewish organizations brought these young people to speak at Hillel? What if this was\n the face of Zionism shown to America's Jewish young? What if the students in Luntz's focus group had been told that\n\n their generation faces a challenge as momentous as any in Jewish history: to save liberal democracy in the only Jewish\n state on earth?\n\n \"Too many years I lived in the warm embrace of institutionalized elusiveness and was a part of it,\" writes Avraham Burg.\n \"I was very comfortable there.\" I know; I was comfortable there too. But comfortable Zionism has become a moral\n\n abdication. Let's hope that Luntz's students, in solidarity with their counterparts at Sheikh Jarrah, can foster an\n\n       <span class=\"unclassified\">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775710 Date: 08/31/2015</span>\n\nuncomfortable Zionism, a Zionism angry at what Israel risks becoming, and in love with what it still could be.

In response, he unwittingly produced the most damning indictment of the organized American Jewish\n community that I have ever seen.\n\n The philanthropists wanted to know what Jewish students thought about Israel. Luntz found that they mostly didn't. \"Six\n times we have brought Jewish youth together as a group to talk about their Jewishness and connection to Israel,\" he\n\n reported. \"Six times the topic of Israel did not come up until it was prompted. Six times these Jewish youth used the\n word 'they' rather than `us' to describe the situation.\"\n\n That Luntz encountered indifference was not surprising. In recent years, several studies have revealed, in the words of\n Steven Cohen of Hebrew Union College and Ari Kelman of the University of California at bavis, that \"non-Orthodox\n\n younger Jews, on the whole, feel much less attached to Israel than their elders,\" with many professing \"a near-total\n absence of positive feelings.\" In 2008, the student senate at Brandeis, the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored university\n\n in America, rejected a resolution commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the Jewish state.\n\n        UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775710 Date: 08/31/2015\n\nLuntz's task was to figure out what had gone wrong. When he probed the students' views of Israel, he hit up against\nsome firm beliefs. First, \"they reserve the right to question the Israeli position.\" These young Jews, Luntz explained,\n\n\"resist anything they see as 'group think.\" They want an \"open and frank\" discussion of Israel and its flaws. Second,\n\"young Jews desperately want peace.\" When Luntz showed them a series of ads, one of the most popular was entitled\n\n\"Proof that Israel Wants Peace,\" and listed offers by various Israeli governments to withdraw from conquered land.\nThird, \"some empathize with the plight of the Palestinians.\" When Luntz displayed ads depicting Palestinians as violent\n\nand hateful, several focus group participants criticized them as stereotypical and unfair, citing their own Muslim friends.\nMost of the students, in other words, were liberals, broadly defined. They had imbibed some of the defining values of\n\nAmerican Jewish political culture: a belief in open debate, a skepticism about military force, a commitment to human\n\nrights. And in their innocence, they did not realize that they were supposed to shed those values when it came to Israel.\nThe only kind of Zionism they found attractive was a Zionism that recognized Palestinians as deserving of dignity and\n\ncapable of peace, and they were quite willing to condemn an Israeli government that did not share those beliefs. Luntz\ndid not grasp the irony. The only kind of Zionism they found attractive was the kind that the American Jewish\n\nestablishment has been working against for most of their lives.\nAmong American Jews today, there are a great many Zionists, especially in the Orthodox world, people deeply devoted\n\nto the State of Israel. And there are a great many liberals, especially in the secular Jewish world, people deeply devoted\nto human rights for all people, Palestinians included. But the two groups are increasingly distinct. Particularly in the\n\nyounger generations, fewer and fewer American Jewish liberals are Zionists; fewer and fewer American Jewish Zionists\nare liberal. One reason is that the leading institutions of American Jewry have refused to fosterï¿½indeed, have actively\n\nopposedï¿½a Zionism that challenges Israel's behavior in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and toward its own Arab citizens.\nFor several decades, the Jewish establishment has asked American Jews to check their liberalism at Zionism's door, and\n\nnow, to their horror, they are finding that many young Jews have checked their Zionism instead.\nMorally, American Zionism is in a downward spiral. If the leaders of groups like AIPAC and the Conference of Presidents\n\nof Major American Jewish Organizations do not change course, they will wake up one day to find a younger, Orthodox-\ndominated, Zionist leadership whose naked hostility to Arabs and Palestinians scares even them, and a mass of secular\n\nAmerican Jews who range from apathetic to appalled. Saving liberal Zionism in the United Statesï¿½so that American\nJews can help save liberal Zionism in Israelï¿½is the great American Jewish challenge of our age. And it starts where\n\n Luntz's students wanted it to start: by talking frankly about Israel's current government, by no longer averting our eyes.\nSince the 1990s, journalists and scholars have been describing a bifurcation in Israeli society. In the words of Hebrew\n\n University political scientist Yaron Ezrahi, \"After decades of what came to be called a national consensus, the Zionist\n narrative of liberation [has] dissolved into openly contesting versions.\" One version, \"founded on a long memory of\n\n persecution, genocide, and a bitter struggle for survival, is pessimistic, distrustful of non-Jews, and believing only in\nJewish power and solidarity.\" Another, \"nourished by secularized versions of messianism as well as the Enlightenment\n\n idea of progress,\" articulates \"a deep sense of the limits of military force, and a commitment to liberal-democratic\n values.\" Every country manifests some kind of ideological divide. But in contemporary Israel, the gulf is among the\n\n widest on earth.\n As Ezrahi and others have noted, this latter, liberal-democratic Zionism has grown alongside a new individualism,\n\n particularly among secular Israelis, a greater demand for free expression, and a greater skepticism of coercive authority.\n You can see this spirit in \"new historians\" like Tom Segev who have fearlessly excavated the darker corners of the Zionist\n\n past and in jurists like former Supreme Court President Aharon Barak who have overturned Knesset laws that violate the\n human rights guarantees in Israel's \"Basic Laws.\" You can also see it in former Prime Minister Ehud Barak's apparent\n\n willingness to relinquish much of the West Bank in 2000 and early 2001.\n But in Israel today, this humane, universalistic Zionism does not wield power. To the contrary, it is gasping for air. To\n\n understand how deeply antithetical its values are to those of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, it's\n worth considering the case of Effi Eitam. Eitam, a charismatic exï¿½cabinet minister and war hero, has proposed ethnically\n\n cleansing Palestinians from the West Bank. \"We'll have to expel the overwhelming majority of West Bank Arabs from\n here and remove Israeli Arabs from [the] political system,\" he declared in 2006. In 2008, Eitam merged his small Ahi\n\n Party into Netanyahu's Likud. And for the 2009-2010 academic year, he is Netanyahu's special emissary for overseas\n \"campus engagement.\" In that capacity, he visited a dozen American high schools and colleges last fall on the Israeli\n\n government's behalf. The group that organized his tour was called \"Caravan for Democracy.\"\n Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman once shared Eitam's views. In his youth, he briefly joined Meir Kahane's now\n\n banned Kach Party, which also advocated the expulsion of Arabs from Israeli soil. Now Lieberman's position might be\n called \"pre-expulsion.\" He wants to revoke the citizenship of Israeli Arabs who won't swear a loyalty oath to the Jewish\n\n        UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775710 Date: 08/31/2015\n\nstate. He tried to prevent two Arab parties that opposed Israel's 2008-2009 Gaza war from running candidates for the\nKnesset. He said Arab Knesset members who met with representatives of Hamas should be executed. He wants to jail\n\nArabs who publicly mourn on Israeli Independence Day, and he hopes to permanently deny citizenship to Arabs from\nother countries who marry Arab citizens of Israel.\n\nYou don't have to be paranoid to see the connection between Lieberman's current views and his former ones. The more\nyou strip Israeli Arabs of legal protection, and the more you accuse them of treason, the more thinkable a policy of\n\nexpulsion becomes. Lieberman's American defenders often note that in theory he supports a Palestinian state. What\nthey usually fail to mention is that for him, a two-state solution means redrawing Israel's border so that a large chunk of\n\nIsraeli Arabs find themselves exiled to another country, without their consent.\nLieberman served as chief of staff during Netanyahu's first term as prime minister. And when it comes to the West Bank,\n\nNetanyahu's own record is in its way even more extreme than his protï¿½gï¿½'s. In his 1993 book, A Place among the\nNations, Netanyahu not only rejects the idea of a Palestinian state, he denies that there is such a thing as a Palestinian.\n\nIn fact, he repeatedly equates the Palestinian bid for statehood with Nazism. An Israel that withdraws from the West\nBank, he has declared, would be a \"ghetto-state\" with \"Auschwitz borders.\" And the effort \"to gouge Judea and Samaria\n\n[the West Bank] out of Israel\" resembles Hitler's bid to wrench the German-speaking \"Sudeten district\" from\nCzechoslovakia in 1938. It is unfair, Netanyahu insists, to ask Israel to concede more territory since it has already made\n\nvast, gut-wrenching concessions. What kind of concessions? It has abandoned its claim to Jordan, which by rights should\nbe part of the Jewish state.\n\nOn the left of Netanyahu's coalition sits Ehud Barak's emasculated Labor Party, but whatever moderating potential it\nmay have is counterbalanced by what is, in some ways, the most illiberal coalition partner of all, Shas, the ultra-\n\nOrthodox party representing Jews of North African and Middle Eastern descent. At one point, Shasï¿½like some of its\nAshkenazi ultra-Orthodox counterpartsï¿½was open to dismantling settlements. In recent years, however, ultra-Orthodox            .\n\nIsraelis, anxious to find housing for their large families, have increasingly moved to the West Bank, where thanks to\ngovernment subsidies it is far cheaper to live. Not coincidentally, their political parties have swung hard against\n\nterritorial compromise. And they have done so with a virulence that reflects ultra-Orthodox Judaism's profound hostility\nto liberal values. Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, Shas's immensely powerful spiritual leader, has called Arabs \"vipers,\" \"snakes,\"\n\nand \"ants.\" In 2005, after Prime Minister Ariel Sharon proposed dismantling settlements in the Gaza Strip, Yosef urged\nthat \"God strike him down.\" The official Shas newspaper recently called President Obama \"an Islamic extremist.\"\n\nHebrew University Professor Ze'ev Sternhell is an expert on fascism and a winner of the prestigious Israel Prize.\nCommenting on Lieberman and the leaders of Shas in a recent Op-Ed in Haaretz, he wrote, \"The last time politicians\n\nholding views similar to theirs were in power in postï¿½World War II Western Europe was in Franco's Spain.\" With their\nblessing, \"a crude and multifaceted campaign is being waged against the foundations of the democratic and liberal\n\norder.\" Sternhell should know. In September 2008, he was injured when a settler set off a pipe bomb at his house.\n Israeli governments come and go, but the Netanyahu coalition is the product of frightening, long-term trends in Israeli\n\nsociety: an ultra-Orthodox population that is increasing dramatically, a settler movement that is growing more radical\nand more entrenched in the Israeli bureaucracy and army, and a Russian immigrant community that is particularly prone\n\nto anti-Arab racism. In 2009, a poll by the Israel Democracy Institute found that 53 percent of Jewish Israelis (and 77\n percent of recent immigrants from the former USSR) support encouraging Arabs to leave the country. Attitudes are\n\n worst among Israel's young. When Israeli high schools held mock elections last year, Lieberman won. This March, a poll\nfound that 56 percent of Jewish Israeli high school studentsï¿½and more than 80 percent of religious Jewish high school\n\nstudentsï¿½would deny Israeli Arabs the right to be elected to the Knesset. An education ministry official called the\n survey \"a huge warning signal in light of the strengthening trends of extremist views among the youth.\"\n\n You might think that such trends, and the sympathy for them expressed by some in Israel's government, would occasion\n substantial public concernï¿½even outrageï¿½among the leaders of organized American Jewry. You would be wrong. In\n\n Israel itself, voices from the left, and even center, warn in increasingly urgent tones about threats to Israeli democracy.\n (Former Prime Ministers Ehud Olmert and Ehud Barak have both said that Israel risks becoming an \"apartheid state\" if it\n\n continues to hold the West Bank. This April, when settlers forced a large Israeli bookstore to stop selling a book critical\n of the occupation, Shulamit Aloni, former head of the dovish Meretz Party, declared that \"Israel has not been\n\n democratic for some time now.\") But in the United States, groups like AIPAC and the Presidents' Conference patrol\n public discourse, scolding people who contradict their vision of Israel as a state in which all leaders cherish democracy\n\n and yearn for peace.\n The result is a terrible irony. In theory, mainstream American Jewish organizations still hew to a liberal vision of Zionism.\n\n On its website, AIPAC celebrates Israel's commitment to \"free speech and minority rights.\" The Conference of Presidents\n\n       UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775710 Date: 08/31/2015\n\ndeclares that \"Israel and the United States share political, moral and intellectual values including democracy, freedom,\nsecurity and peace.\" These groups would never say, as do some in Netanyahu's coalition, that Israeli Arabs don't deserve\n\nfull citizenship and West Bank Palestinians don't deserve human rights. But in practice, by defending virtually anything\nany Israeli government does, they make themselves intellectual bodyguards for Israeli leaders who threaten the very\n\nliberal values they profess to admire.\nAfter Israel's elections last February, for instance, Malcolm Hoenlein, executive vice-chairman of the Presidents'\n\nConference, explained that Avigdor Lieberman's agenda was \"far more moderate than the media has presented it.\"\nInsisting that Lieberman bears no general animus toward Israeli Arabs, Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-\n\nDefamation League, told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency that \"He's not saying expel them. He's not saying punish them.\"\n(Permanently denying citizenship to their Arab spouses or jailing them if they publicly mourn on Israeli Independence\n\nDay evidently does not qualify as punishment.) The ADL has criticized anti-Arab bigotry in the past, and the American\nJewish Committee, to its credit, warned that Lieberman's proposed loyalty oath would \"chill Israel's democratic political\n\ndebate.\" But the Forward summed up the overall response of America's communal Jewish leadership in its headline\n\n\"Jewish Leaders Largely Silent on Lieberman's Role in Government.\"\n\nNot only does the organized American Jewish community mostly avoid public criticism of the Israeli government, it tries\nto prevent others from leveling such criticism as well. In recent years, American Jewish organizations have waged a\n\ncampaign to discredit the world's most respected international human rights groups. In 2006, Foxman called an Amnesty\nInternational report on Israeli killing of Lebanese civilians \"bigoted, biased, and borderline anti-Semitic.\" The Conference\n\nof Presidents has announced that \"biased NGOs include Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Christian Aid,\n[and] Save the Children.\" Last summer, an AIPAC spokesman declared that Human Rights Watch \"has repeatedly\n\ndemonstrated its anti-Israel bias.\" When the Obama administration awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Mary\nRobinson, former UN high commissioner for human rights, the ADL and AIPAC both protested, citing the fact that she\n\nhad presided over the 2001 World Conference Against Racism in Durban, South Africa. (Early drafts of the conference\nreport implicitly accused Israel of racism. Robinson helped expunge that defamatory charge, angering Syria and Iran.)\n\n Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International are not infallible. But when groups like AIPAC and the Presidents'\nConference avoid virtually all public criticism of Israeli actionsï¿½directing their outrage solely at Israel's neighborsï¿½they\n\n leave themselves in a poor position to charge bias. Moreover, while American Jewish groups claim that they are simply\ndefending Israel from its foes, they are actually taking sides in a struggle within Israel between radically different Zionist\n\nvisions. At the very moment the Anti-Defamation League claimed that Robinson harbored an \"animus toward Israel,\" an\nalliance of seven Israeli human rights groups publicly congratulated her on her award. Many of those groups, like\n\n B'Tselem, which monitors Israeli actions in the Occupied Territories, and the Israeli branch of Physicians for Human\n Rights, have been at least as critical of Israel's actions in Lebanon, Gaza, and the West Bank as have Amnesty\n\n International and Human Rights Watch.\n All of which raises an uncomfortable question. If American Jewish groups claim that Israel's overseas human rights critics\n\n are motivated by anti- Israeli, if not anti-Semitic, bias, what does that say about Israel's domestic human rights critics?\n The implication is clear: they must be guilty of self-hatred, if not treason. American Jewish leaders don't generally say\n\n that, of course, but their allies in the Netanyahu government do. Last summer, Israel's vice prime minister, Moshe\n Ya'alon, called the anti-occupation group Peace Now a \"virus.\" This January, a right-wing group called Im Tirtzu accused\n\n Israeli human rights organizations of having fed information to the Goldstone Commission that investigated Israel's Gaza\n war. A Knesset member from Netanyahu's Likud promptly charged Naomi Chazan, head of the New Israel Fund, which\n\n supports some of those human rights groups, with treason, and a member of Lieberman's party launched an\n investigation aimed at curbing foreign funding of Israeli NGOs.\n\n To their credit, Foxman and other American Jewish leaders opposed the move, which might have impaired their own\n work. But they are reaping what they sowed. If you suggest that mainstream human rights criticism of Israel's\n\n government is motivated by animus toward the state, or toward Jews in general, you give aid and comfort to those in\n Israel who make the same charges against the human rights critics in their midst.\n\n In the American Jewish establishment today, the language of liberal Zionismï¿½with its idioms of human rights, equal\n citizenship, and territorial compromiseï¿½has been drained of meaning. It remains the lingua franca in part for\n\n generational reasons, because many older American Zionists still see themselves as liberals of a sort. They vote\n Democratic; they are unmoved by biblical claims to the West Bank; they see average Palestinians as decent people\n\n betrayed by bad leaders; and they are secular. They don't want Jewish organizations to criticize Israel from the left, but\n neither do they want them to be agents of the Israeli right.\n\n       UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775710 Date: 08/31/2015\n\nThese American Zionists are largely the product of a particular era. Many were shaped by the terrifying days leading up\nto the Six-Day War, when it appeared that Israel might be overrun, and by the bitter aftermath of the Yom Kippur War,\n\nwhen much of the world seemed to turn against the Jewish state. In that crucible, Israel became their Jewish identity,\noften in conjunction with the Holocaust, which the 1967 and 1973 wars helped make central to American Jewish life.\n\nThese Jews embraced Zionism before the settler movement became a major force in Israeli politics, before the 1982\nLebanon war, before the first intifada. They fell in love with an Israel that was more secular, less divided, and less shaped\n\nby the culture, politics, and theology of occupation. And by downplaying the significance of Avigdor Lieberman, the\nsettlers, and Shas, American Jewish groups allow these older Zionists to continue to identify with that more internally\n\ncohesive, more innocent Israel of their youth, an Israel that now only exists in their memories.\nBut these secular Zionists aren't reproducing themselves. Their children have no memory of Arab armies massed on\n\nIsrael's border and of Israel surviving in part thanks to urgent military assistance from the United States. Instead, they\nhave grown up viewing Israel as a regional hegemon and an occupying power. As a result, they are more conscious than\n\ntheir parents of the degree to which Israeli behavior violates liberal ideals, and less willing to grant Israel an exemption\nbecause its survival seems in peril. Because they have inherited their parents' liberalism, they cannot embrace their\n\nuncritical Zionism. Because their liberalism is real, they can see that the liberalism of the American Jewish establishment\nis fake.\n\nTo sustain their uncritical brand of Zionism, therefore, America's Jewish organizations will need to look elsewhere to\nreplenish their ranks. They will need to find young American Jews who have come of age during the West Bank\n\noccupation but are not troubled by it. And those young American Jews will come disproportionately from the Orthodox\nworld.\n\nBecause they marry earlier, intermarry less, and have more children, Orthodox Jews are growing rapidly as a share of\nthe American Jewish population. According to a 2006 American Jewish Committee (AJC) survey, while Orthodox Jews\n\nmake up only 12 percent of American Jewry over the age of sixty, they constitute 34 percent between the ages of\neighteen and twenty-four. For America's Zionist organizations, these Orthodox youngsters are a potential bonanza. In\n\ntheir yeshivas they learn devotion to Israel from an early age; they generally spend a year of religious study there after\nhigh school, and often know friends or relatives who have immigrated to Israel. The same AJC study found that while\n\nonly 16 percent of non-Orthodox adult Jews under the age of forty feel \"very close to Israel,\" among the Orthodox the\nfigure is 79 percent. As secular Jews drift away from America's Zionist institutions, their Orthodox counterparts will likely\n\nstep into the breach. The Orthodox \"are still interested in parochial Jewish concerns,\" explains Samuel Heilman, a\nsociologist at the City University of New York. \"They are among the last ones who stayed in the Jewish house, so they\n\nnow control the lights.\"\nBut it is this very parochialismï¿½a deep commitment to Jewish concerns, which often outweighs more universal onesï¿½\n\nthat gives Orthodox Jewish Zionism a distinctly illiberal cast. The 2006 AJC poll found that while 60 percent of non-\nOrthodox American Jews under the age of forty support a Palestinian state, that figure drops to 25 percent among the\n\nOrthodox. In 2009, when Brandeis University's Theodore Sasson asked American Jewish focus groups about Israel, he\nfound Orthodox participants much less supportive of dismantling settlements as part of a peace deal. Even more\n\ntellingly, Reform, Conservative, and unaffiliated Jews tended to believe that average Palestinians wanted peace, but had\n been ill-served by their leaders. Orthodox Jews, by contrast, were more likely to see the Palestinian people as the\n\nenemy, and to deny that ordinary Palestinians shared any common interests or values with ordinary Israelis or Jews.\nOrthodox Judaism has great virtues, including a communal warmth and a commitment to Jewish learning unmatched in\n\nthe American Jewish world. (I'm biased, since my family attends an Orthodox synagogue.) But if current trends continue,\nthe growing influence of Orthodox Jews in America's Jewish communal institutions will erode even the liberal-\n\ndemocratic veneer that today covers American Zionism. In 2002, America's major Jewish organizations sponsored a large\n Israel solidarity rally on the Washington Mall. Up and down the east coast, yeshivas shut down for the day, swelling the\n\nestimated Orthodox share of the crowd to close to 70 percent. When the then Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul\n Wolfowitz told the rally that \"innocent Palestinians are suffering and dying as well,\" he was booed.\n\n America's Jewish leaders should think hard about that rally. Unless they change course, it portends the future: an\n American Zionist movement that does not even feign concern for Palestinian dignity and a broader American Jewish\n\n population that does not even feign concern for Israel. My own children, given their upbringing, could as easily end up\n\n among the booers as among Luntz's focus group. Either prospect fills me with dread.\n In 2004, in an effort to prevent weapons smuggling from Egypt, Israeli tanks and bulldozers demolished hundreds of\n\n houses in the Rafah refugee camp in the southern Gaza Strip. Watching television, a veteran Israeli commentator and\n\n        UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775710 Date: 08/31/2015\n\n'politician named Tommy Lapid saw an elderly Palestinian woman crouched on all fours looking for her medicines amid\n the ruins of her home. He said she reminded him of his grandmother.\n\n In that moment, Lapid captured the spirit that is suffocating within organized American Jewish life. To begin with, he\n watched. In my experience, there is an epidemic of not watching among American Zionists today. A Red Cross study on\n\n malnutrition in the Gaza Strip, a bill in the Knesset to allow Jewish neighborhoods to bar entry to Israeli Arabs, an Israeli\n human rights report on settlers burning Palestinian olive groves, three more Palestinian teenagers shotï¿½it's unpleasant.\n\n Rationalizing and minimizing Palestinian suffering has become a kind of game. In a more recent report on how to foster\n Zionism among America's young, Luntz urges American Jewish groups to use the word \"Arabs, not Palestinians,\" since\n\n \"the term 'Palestinians' evokes images of refugee camps, victims and oppression,\" while \"Arab' says wealth, oil and\n Islam./7\n\n Of course, Israelï¿½like the United Statesï¿½must sometimes take morally difficult actions in its own defense. But they are\n morally difficult only if you allow yourself some human connection to the other side. Otherwise, security justifies\n\n everything. The heads of AIPAC and the Presidents' Conference should ask themselves what Israel's leaders would have\n to do or say to make them scream \"no.\" After all, Lieberman is foreign minister; Effi Eitam is touring American\n\n universities; settlements are growing at triple the rate of the Israeli population; half of Israeli Jewish high school\n students want Arabs barred from the Knesset. If the line has not yet been crossed, where is the line?\n\n What infuriated critics about Lapid's comment was that his grandmother died at Auschwitz. How dare he defile the\n memory of the Holocaust? Of course, the Holocaust is immeasurably worse than anything Israel has done or ever will\n\n do. But at least Lapid used Jewish suffering to connect to the suffering of others. In the world of AIPAC, the Holocaust\n analogies never stop, and their message is always the same: Jews are licensed by their victimhood to worry only about\n\n themselves. Many of Israel's founders believed that with statehood, Jews would rightly be judged on the way they\n treated the non-Jews living under their dominion. \"For the first time we shall be the majority living with a minority,\"\n\n Knesset member Pinchas Lavon declared in 1948, \"and we shall be called upon to provide an example and prove how\n Jews live with a minority.\"\n\n But the message of the American Jewish establishment and its allies in the Netanyahu government is exactly the\n opposite: since Jews are history's permanent victims, always on the knife-edge of extinction, moral responsibility is a\n\n luxury Israel does not have. Its only responsibility is to survive. As former Knesset speaker Avraham Burg writes in his\n remarkable 2008 book, The Holocaust Is Over; We Must Rise From Its Ashes, \"Victimhood sets you free.\"\n\n This obsession with victimhood lies at the heart of why Zionism is dying among America's secular Jewish young. It simply\n bears no relationship to their lived experience, or what they have seen of Israel's. Yes, Israel faces threats from\n\n Hezbollah and Hamas. Yes, Israelis understandably worry about a nuclear Iran. But the dilemmas you face when you\n possess dozens or hundreds of nuclear weapons, and your adversary, however despicable, may acquire one, are not the\n\n dilemmas of the Warsaw Ghetto. The year 2010 is not, as Benjamin Netanyahu has claimed, 1938. The drama of Jewish\n victimhoodï¿½a drama that feels natural to many Jews who lived through 1938, 1948, or even 1967ï¿½strikes most of\n\n today's young American Jews as farce.\n But there is a different Zionist calling, which has never been more desperately relevant. It has its roots in Israel's\n\n Independence Proclamation, which promised that the Jewish state \"will be based on the precepts of liberty, justice and\n peace taught by the Hebrew prophets,\" and in the December 1948 letter from Albert Einstein, Hannah Arendt, and\n\n others to The New York Times, protesting right-wing Zionist leader Menachem Begin's visit to the United States after his\n party's militias massacred Arab civilians in the village of Deir Yassin. It is a call to recognize that in a world in which\n\n Jewish fortunes haveï¿½radically changed, the best way to memorialize the history of Jewish suffering is through the\n ethical use of Jewish power.\n\n For several months now, a group of Israeli students has been traveling every Friday to the East Jerusalem neighborhood\n of Sheikh Jarrah, where a Palestinian family named the Ghawis lives on the street outside their home of fifty-three years,\n\n from which they were evicted to make room for Jewish settlers. Although repeatedly arrested for protesting without a\n permit, and called traitors and self-haters by the Israeli right, the students keep coming, their numbers now swelling into\n\n the thousands. What if American Jewish organizations brought these young people to speak at Hillel? What if this was\n the face of Zionism shown to America's Jewish young? What if the students in Luntz's focus group had been told that\n\n their generation faces a challenge as momentous as any in Jewish history: to save liberal democracy in the only Jewish\n state on earth?\n\n \"Too many years I lived in the warm embrace of institutionalized elusiveness and was a part of it,\" writes Avraham Burg.\n \"I was very comfortable there.\" I know; I was comfortable there too. But comfortable Zionism has become a moral\n\n abdication. Let's hope that Luntz's students, in solidarity with their counterparts at Sheikh Jarrah, can foster an\n\n       UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775710 Date: 08/31/2015\n\nuncomfortable Zionism, a Zionism angry at what Israel risks becoming, and in love with what it still could be. Let's hope\nthey care enough to try.\n\nï¿½May 12, 2010\nPeter Beinart is Associate Professor of Journalism and Political Science at the City University of New York, a Senior Fellow\nat the New America Foundation, and Senior Political Writer for The Daily Beast.

This weekend, he will graduate from Howard\nUniversity Law School.\n\nHe remembers the shaky foundation of his young life. A mother who could not take care of him. He lived in six foster\n\nhomes in ten years.\n\n\"Moving to these different homes. The kids were like 'you weren't here yesterday.' Where's your mom at?\" said\nFreeman.\n\nAt 18 years old, he left the system and went to college in search of room and board. He knew what people expected of\n\nkids in the foster care system - not much.\n\n\"All I would hear is that they were in jail or homeless or weren't doing too well,\" said Freeman.\n\nHe beat the odds and graduated, but he felt ... alone.\n\n\"I can distinctly remember walking across the stage in undergrad. You know at graduation everyone has their   cheer\nsection that yells as you walk across the stage and there was almost silence as I walked across,\" said Freeman.\n\n It will be different this time. When Freeman gets his diploma Saturday at the convention center, there will be 26 people\n\n- friends and supporters from as far away as California - in D.C. to show their support.\n\n Freeman also got a boost from an internship program for kids who have spent time in foster care. He was placed in the\n office of then Senator Hillary Clinton. Clinton even mentions him in the updated version of her book \"It Takes A Village.\"\n\n Now, he may use his law degree to work on public policy - especially children's issues. He wants all kids to know:\n\n \"There's a bright future out there for you if you stay focused and work hard.\"\n\n     <span class=\"unclassified\">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774847 Date: 08/31/2015</span>\n\nAnd to the adults who hear his story, Freeman said help a child.

Re: Sunday, State of Play\n\n   Clegg is still in talks with Cameron. About 1,500 Liberal Democrats spontaneously protested at Lib-Dem headquarters\n   against a deal with the Tories given their policies, especially on Europe. But Clegg remains in negotiations. He seems\n\n   quite intent on working it out with Cameron, it appears. His inner Tory magnetically draws him to his heritage. Clegg has\n   also misplayed almost every turn, presented with big chances and blowing them through a combination of inexperience\n\n   (derived partly from heading a party out of power for nearly 100 years) and inbred arrogance (from no less a privileged\n   background than Cameron, though seeming less snobbish because he went to Westminster instead of Eton and has a\n\n   less pronounced upper-class accent, more neutral, because of his more cosmopolitan roots through his family).\n\n   What about Labour? Shaun and a couple of others have rounded up about 29 votes from other parties (Scottish National\n    Party, NI parties, Welsh party) that could be part of a grand progressive once-in-a-lifetime coalition that required the\n\n    LDs. Gordon has said he will allow Clegg-Cameron discussions to play out and a general offer to Clegg is on the table, its\n   terms giving far more on a referendum and policy than the Tories. Behind the scenes, Labour is putting whatever harsh\n\n    pressure it can on LD leaders. Peter is playing a cynical double game. He is a sectarian in a sect of one. Yet Gordon for\n   strange psychological reasons rooted in his triangle with Tony and Peter relies on Peter. Peter, according to Shaun, has\n\n   wrung a pledge from Borwn that if Brown emerges from this crisis he, Peter, will replace David as Foreign Secretary.\n    Meanwhile, Peter has advised David to sideline himself. David has done so instead of being forward as a strong party\n\n    man behind Brown in dire straits. Standing back only makes David look ambitious, waiting for Brown to lose and aiming\n   to a leadership contest afterward, when Peter, as he has promised, would guide David to the prize. The plot thickens: Ed\n\n      <span class=\"unclassified\">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774756 Date: 08/31/2015</span>\n\nMiliband, David's younger brother, the environment secretary, will run for leader against his brother if Brown loses. Ed\nhas more of a common touch. The outcome of that contest would be more than uncertain. But before that eventuality\n\nGordon's team reaches out to the LDs in private. Yet Shaun's attitude, as I read it, leans toward pessmism. A London\nTimes polls just out says 62 percent want Gordon out. Where were the fickle voters in the election? The poll shows more\n\nthan discontent with Gordon, but also how people are being whipped by the Murdoch media.\n\nWhat about the Tories? A secret memo from William Hague to Cameron written before the election was leaked this\nmorning to The Observer (the Sunday paper of The Guardian), proposes an anti-Europe line of the new government.\n\n(I've enclosed the article below.) The atmosphere inside the Conservatives is acrid and anxious. But Lord Ashcroft, the\n\nTory moneyman, who spent five million pounds alone in marginal districts, is furious that Cameron failed to win outright,\nfailed in his campaign, made a foolish decision to include Clegg in the debates, etc. Many agree with the evil Ashcroft.\n\nBut the finger pointing won't matter if a deal works with Clegg. The Conservative strategy would be to coopt Clegg now,\ndo whatever deal can be done, maintain a more or less center-right but moderated government for about a year, call a\n\nnew election, win outright on the momentum of the recovery engineered by Brown but claimed by Tories as proof that\nthe change was responsible, jettison Clegg and the LDs, and govern from the radical right as the children of Thatcher for\n\nfive years. The Tories would then move on their electoral reforms: cutting the number of seats in Parliament,\nredistricting in Conservative favor, and trying to outlaw union contributions to the Labour Party.\n\nWhat about the LDs? Clegg's deal with the Tories would of course thwart any Lib-Lab coalition, probably the only chance\n\nfor a grand progressive alliance that would keep the Tories out of power forever. Clegg's personal instincts obviously\nlean toward the Tories, having little to do with policy. The party's leaders may be opposed, but they are also likely to be\n\nfeckless and weak as they always have been.\n\nSo, whatever the case, I would doubt you'll see David again as Foreign Secretary. Prepare for hauge, who is deeply anti-\nEuropean and will be disingenuous with you. Tory budget cuts in NI, already announced, would cause havoc with peace\n\nand economic recovery. I'd send a private message asap on that score the second a new government is announced, if it\nis. Tilt publicly to Merkel on Europe for this reason among others.\n\nArticle below:\n\nTory-Lib Dem coalition threatened by secret hardline memo on Europe ï¿½ Draft letter by William Hague sets out tough\nstance on EU ï¿½ Leak follows leaders\"constructive, amicable' meeting Toby Helm\n\n<http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/tobyhelm     > and Anushka Asthana\n<http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/anushkaasthana>\n\n        The Observer <http://observerguardian.co.uk> , Sunday 9 May 2010\n\nDavid Cameron <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davidcameron        > 's hopes of forming a coalition with the Liberal\n\nDemocrats <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/Iiberaldemocrats      > were dramatically undermined last night by the\nleaking of a top-secret letter outlining the hardline Eurosceptic stance he and William Hague\n\n<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/williamhague    > planned to adopt in government.\nThe document, obtained by the Observer, is headed \"draft letter from Foreign Secretary to Prime Minister\" and was\n\nwritten last week. It assumed an outright Tory victory and spelt out how Hague intended to adopt a tough approach to\nEurope at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels tomorrow.\n\nIn the letter, compiled by civil servants but written in the first person, Hague tells Cameron how his message would be\nthat \"the British relationship with the EU has changed with our election\" to one firmly against any further integration.\n\nExposing the massive gulf between Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/nickclegg      >\nand the Conservative leadership on Europe, Hague says he would demand the right to repatriate powers over criminal\n\njustice as well as social and employment policy during the first term of a Tory government ï¿½ demands many EU leaders\nsay they would resist.\n\nHague planned to tell his EU counterparts: \"Rest assured that we seek engagement, not confrontation. But our aim is to\nachieve these commitments during this parliament.\" He would also tell his first foreign ministers' meeting \"we will never\n\njoin the euro\" and conclude: \"You will find us firm but fair, playing a leading role, fighting our corner, practical and\nstraight-talking.\"\n\n     <span class=\"unclassified\">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774756 Date: 08/31/2015</span>\n\nLast night the Tories said they had no knowledge of the letter. But the Observer understands it was drawn up on the\nbasis of detailed briefings between senior civil servants and Hague. The document came to light as Clegg, a strong pro-\n\nEuropean, yesterday met his MPs and senior party figures to discuss a possible coalition with the Tories, who emerged\nfrom Thursday's general election with the largest number of seats but short of an overall majority.\n\nCameron and Clegg held face-to-face talks late yesterday as they continued their attempts to thrash out a power-sharing\ndeal. A senior Conservative party spokeswoman said the talks were \"constructive and amicable\". The 70-minute meeting\n\ntook place at Admiralty House in Whitehall. A Lib Dem spokesman also described the discussions as \"constructive and\namicable\".\n\nTory and Lib Dem sources said last night that discussions would not conclude until the beginning of the coming week at\n\nthe earliest. An emergency meeting of the 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers will be held tomorrow to discuss the\npossible coalition. Today, Hague, Oliver Letwin <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/oliverletwin> and George Osborne\n\n<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/georgeosborne> will resume talks with the Lib Dems' Vince Cable, Chris Huhne\nand David Laws.\n\nBut the stark language used in the letter is bound to alarm Clegg, who has been savage in his criticism of the\nConservatives <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/conservatives>' attitude to Europe which he believes is rooted in\n\nthe past and will limit Britain's ability to fight cross-border crime and meet the environmental challenges of the 21st\ncentury.\n\nThe document will also be seen by Lib Dem MPs and the party's rank and file as evidence that their pro-Europeanism\nwould be compromised by linking up with the Tories. A Lib Dem spokesman said the party was strongly pro-European,\n\nbut would not be drawn on the document.\nYesterday Cameron came under pressure from senior figures in his own party not to give in to Clegg's demands by\n\nwatering down Conservative manifesto commitments. Shadow defence secretary Liam Fox warned that a Tory\ngovernment could not be \"held to ransom\" by Lib Dems demanding proportional representation.\n\nClegg may also face opposition from within his party to any attempt to form a coalition with the Tories, particularly on\neconomic issues.\n\nYesterday the Social Liberal Forum, which represents left-leaning Lib Dems and includes a third of the party's MPs,\nissued a set of \"red lines\" which it said the party must not cross, including any measure that would increase the gap\n\nbetween the rich and poorï¿½ ruling out supporting the Tory pledge to cut inheritance tax. Three other red lines were any\nsuggestion of cuts to frontline services in the current financial year, any worsening treatment of asylum seekers and any\n\nwatering-down of the human rights act.\nMeanwhile, Gordon Brown and his closest advisers were working on how to expand their counter-offer to the Lib Dems,\n\nincluding a referendum on changes to the voting system. Senior officials said Labour was planning to draw up a formal\n\"coalition contract\" ï¿½ as happens in Germany ï¿½ that would bind the Lib Dems and other smaller parties into a deal if the\n\nTory discussions with the Lib Dems were to fail.\nMost Labour ministers now believe Brown would have to step down before Clegg would consider a pact, though senior\n\ngovernment insiders insisted this was not being discussed as an option.\nOne re-elected Labour MP, John Mann, of Bassetlaw, called on Brown to step down as Labour leader, claiming that the\n\nparty would have influence on the outcome of the current negotiations only if Brown agreed to give up the leadership.\n\"Brown should not lead Labour into any future election and he should stand down before the next Labour party\n\nconference,\" he said. \"Gordon Brown's continuation as leader rules out the credibility of a Lib-Lab pact that has to\nprioritise the modernisation and reform of the antiquated UK political systems.\"\n\t\t\t\t</div></div>",

Re: Sunday, State of Play\n\n   Clegg is still in talks with Cameron. About 1,500 Liberal Democrats spontaneously protested at Lib-Dem headquarters\n   against a deal with the Tories given their policies, especially on Europe. But Clegg remains in negotiations. He seems\n\n   quite intent on working it out with Cameron, it appears. His inner Tory magnetically draws him to his heritage. Clegg has\n   also misplayed almost every turn, presented with big chances and blowing them through a combination of inexperience\n\n   (derived partly from heading a party out of power for nearly 100 years) and inbred arrogance (from no less a privileged\n   background than Cameron, though seeming less snobbish because he went to Westminster instead of Eton and has a\n\n   less pronounced upper-class accent, more neutral, because of his more cosmopolitan roots through his family).\n\n   What about Labour? Shaun and a couple of others have rounded up about 29 votes from other parties (Scottish National\n    Party, NI parties, Welsh party) that could be part of a grand progressive once-in-a-lifetime coalition that required the\n\n    LDs. Gordon has said he will allow Clegg-Cameron discussions to play out and a general offer to Clegg is on the table, its\n   terms giving far more on a referendum and policy than the Tories. Behind the scenes, Labour is putting whatever harsh\n\n    pressure it can on LD leaders. Peter is playing a cynical double game. He is a sectarian in a sect of one. Yet Gordon for\n   strange psychological reasons rooted in his triangle with Tony and Peter relies on Peter. Peter, according to Shaun, has\n\n   wrung a pledge from Borwn that if Brown emerges from this crisis he, Peter, will replace David as Foreign Secretary.\n    Meanwhile, Peter has advised David to sideline himself. David has done so instead of being forward as a strong party\n\n    man behind Brown in dire straits. Standing back only makes David look ambitious, waiting for Brown to lose and aiming\n   to a leadership contest afterward, when Peter, as he has promised, would guide David to the prize. The plot thickens: Ed\n\n      UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774756 Date: 08/31/2015\n\nMiliband, David's younger brother, the environment secretary, will run for leader against his brother if Brown loses. Ed\nhas more of a common touch. The outcome of that contest would be more than uncertain. But before that eventuality\n\nGordon's team reaches out to the LDs in private. Yet Shaun's attitude, as I read it, leans toward pessmism. A London\nTimes polls just out says 62 percent want Gordon out. Where were the fickle voters in the election? The poll shows more\n\nthan discontent with Gordon, but also how people are being whipped by the Murdoch media.\n\nWhat about the Tories? A secret memo from William Hague to Cameron written before the election was leaked this\nmorning to The Observer (the Sunday paper of The Guardian), proposes an anti-Europe line of the new government.\n\n(I've enclosed the article below.) The atmosphere inside the Conservatives is acrid and anxious. But Lord Ashcroft, the\n\nTory moneyman, who spent five million pounds alone in marginal districts, is furious that Cameron failed to win outright,\nfailed in his campaign, made a foolish decision to include Clegg in the debates, etc. Many agree with the evil Ashcroft.\n\nBut the finger pointing won't matter if a deal works with Clegg. The Conservative strategy would be to coopt Clegg now,\ndo whatever deal can be done, maintain a more or less center-right but moderated government for about a year, call a\n\nnew election, win outright on the momentum of the recovery engineered by Brown but claimed by Tories as proof that\nthe change was responsible, jettison Clegg and the LDs, and govern from the radical right as the children of Thatcher for\n\nfive years. The Tories would then move on their electoral reforms: cutting the number of seats in Parliament,\nredistricting in Conservative favor, and trying to outlaw union contributions to the Labour Party.\n\nWhat about the LDs? Clegg's deal with the Tories would of course thwart any Lib-Lab coalition, probably the only chance\n\nfor a grand progressive alliance that would keep the Tories out of power forever. Clegg's personal instincts obviously\nlean toward the Tories, having little to do with policy. The party's leaders may be opposed, but they are also likely to be\n\nfeckless and weak as they always have been.\n\nSo, whatever the case, I would doubt you'll see David again as Foreign Secretary. Prepare for hauge, who is deeply anti-\nEuropean and will be disingenuous with you. Tory budget cuts in NI, already announced, would cause havoc with peace\n\nand economic recovery. I'd send a private message asap on that score the second a new government is announced, if it\nis. Tilt publicly to Merkel on Europe for this reason among others.\n\nArticle below:\n\nTory-Lib Dem coalition threatened by secret hardline memo on Europe ï¿½ Draft letter by William Hague sets out tough\nstance on EU ï¿½ Leak follows leaders\"constructive, amicable' meeting Toby Helm\n\n<http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/tobyhelm     > and Anushka Asthana\n<http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/anushkaasthana>\n\n        The Observer <http://observerguardian.co.uk> , Sunday 9 May 2010\n\nDavid Cameron <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davidcameron        > 's hopes of forming a coalition with the Liberal\n\nDemocrats <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/Iiberaldemocrats      > were dramatically undermined last night by the\nleaking of a top-secret letter outlining the hardline Eurosceptic stance he and William Hague\n\n<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/williamhague    > planned to adopt in government.\nThe document, obtained by the Observer, is headed \"draft letter from Foreign Secretary to Prime Minister\" and was\n\nwritten last week. It assumed an outright Tory victory and spelt out how Hague intended to adopt a tough approach to\nEurope at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels tomorrow.\n\nIn the letter, compiled by civil servants but written in the first person, Hague tells Cameron how his message would be\nthat \"the British relationship with the EU has changed with our election\" to one firmly against any further integration.\n\nExposing the massive gulf between Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/nickclegg      >\nand the Conservative leadership on Europe, Hague says he would demand the right to repatriate powers over criminal\n\njustice as well as social and employment policy during the first term of a Tory government ï¿½ demands many EU leaders\nsay they would resist.\n\nHague planned to tell his EU counterparts: \"Rest assured that we seek engagement, not confrontation. But our aim is to\nachieve these commitments during this parliament.\" He would also tell his first foreign ministers' meeting \"we will never\n\njoin the euro\" and conclude: \"You will find us firm but fair, playing a leading role, fighting our corner, practical and\nstraight-talking.\"\n\n     UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774756 Date: 08/31/2015\n\nLast night the Tories said they had no knowledge of the letter. But the Observer understands it was drawn up on the\nbasis of detailed briefings between senior civil servants and Hague. The document came to light as Clegg, a strong pro-\n\nEuropean, yesterday met his MPs and senior party figures to discuss a possible coalition with the Tories, who emerged\nfrom Thursday's general election with the largest number of seats but short of an overall majority.\n\nCameron and Clegg held face-to-face talks late yesterday as they continued their attempts to thrash out a power-sharing\ndeal. A senior Conservative party spokeswoman said the talks were \"constructive and amicable\". The 70-minute meeting\n\ntook place at Admiralty House in Whitehall. A Lib Dem spokesman also described the discussions as \"constructive and\namicable\".\n\nTory and Lib Dem sources said last night that discussions would not conclude until the beginning of the coming week at\n\nthe earliest. An emergency meeting of the 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers will be held tomorrow to discuss the\npossible coalition. Today, Hague, Oliver Letwin <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/oliverletwin> and George Osborne\n\n<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/georgeosborne> will resume talks with the Lib Dems' Vince Cable, Chris Huhne\nand David Laws.\n\nBut the stark language used in the letter is bound to alarm Clegg, who has been savage in his criticism of the\nConservatives <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/conservatives>' attitude to Europe which he believes is rooted in\n\nthe past and will limit Britain's ability to fight cross-border crime and meet the environmental challenges of the 21st\ncentury.\n\nThe document will also be seen by Lib Dem MPs and the party's rank and file as evidence that their pro-Europeanism\nwould be compromised by linking up with the Tories. A Lib Dem spokesman said the party was strongly pro-European,\n\nbut would not be drawn on the document.\nYesterday Cameron came under pressure from senior figures in his own party not to give in to Clegg's demands by\n\nwatering down Conservative manifesto commitments. Shadow defence secretary Liam Fox warned that a Tory\ngovernment could not be \"held to ransom\" by Lib Dems demanding proportional representation.\n\nClegg may also face opposition from within his party to any attempt to form a coalition with the Tories, particularly on\neconomic issues.\n\nYesterday the Social Liberal Forum, which represents left-leaning Lib Dems and includes a third of the party's MPs,\nissued a set of \"red lines\" which it said the party must not cross, including any measure that would increase the gap\n\nbetween the rich and poorï¿½ ruling out supporting the Tory pledge to cut inheritance tax. Three other red lines were any\nsuggestion of cuts to frontline services in the current financial year, any worsening treatment of asylum seekers and any\n\nwatering-down of the human rights act.\nMeanwhile, Gordon Brown and his closest advisers were working on how to expand their counter-offer to the Lib Dems,\n\nincluding a referendum on changes to the voting system. Senior officials said Labour was planning to draw up a formal\n\"coalition contract\" ï¿½ as happens in Germany ï¿½ that would bind the Lib Dems and other smaller parties into a deal if the\n\nTory discussions with the Lib Dems were to fail.\nMost Labour ministers now believe Brown would have to step down before Clegg would consider a pact, though senior\n\ngovernment insiders insisted this was not being discussed as an option.\nOne re-elected Labour MP, John Mann, of Bassetlaw, called on Brown to step down as Labour leader, claiming that the\n\nparty would have influence on the outcome of the current negotiations only if Brown agreed to give up the leadership.\n\"Brown should not lead Labour into any future election and he should stand down before the next Labour party\n\nconference,\" he said. \"Gordon Brown's continuation as leader rules out the credibility of a Lib-Lab pact that has to\nprioritise the modernisation and reform of the antiquated UK political systems.\"\n\t\t\t\t"

Xu\n\nYuyuan, 47, an unemployed local man, broke into a classroom in Taixing city of eastern Jiangsu province on Thursday\nmorning, attacking the children with a 20 cm long knife, the official Xinhua news agency said. The injured children were\n\nall about four years old, and five are in critical condition, it added.

He is also a\n principal in Salute Capital Management Ltd. Simon Johnson, the former chief economist at the International Monetary\n\n Fund, is the co-author of \"13 Bankers.\"The Greek \"rescue\" package announced last weekend is dramatic, unprecedented\n and far from enough to stabilize the euro zone.The Greek government and the European Union leadership, prodded by\n\n the International Monetary Fund, are 'finally becoming realistic about the dire economic situation in Greece. They have\n abandoned previous rounds of optimistic forecasts and have now admitted to a profoundly worse situation. This new\n\n program calls for \"fiscal adjustments\" ï¿½ cuts to the fiscal deficit, mostly through spending cuts ï¿½ totaling 11 percent of\n gross domestic product in 2010, 4.3 percent in 2011, and 2 percent in 2012 and 2013. The total debt-to-G.D.P. ratio\n\n peaks at 149 percent in 2012-13 before starting a gentle glide path back down to sanity.This new program is honest\n enough to show why it is unlikely to succeed.Daniel Gros, an eminent economist on euro zone issues based in Brussels,\n\n has argued that for each 1 percent of G.D.P. decline in Greek government spending, total demand in the country falls by\n 2.5 percent of G.D.P. If the government reduces spending by 15 percent of G.D.P. ï¿½ the initial shock to demand could\n\n be well over 30 percent of G.D.P.Obviously this simple rule does not work with such large numbers, but it illustrates that\n Greece is likely to experience a very sharp recession ï¿½ and there is substantial uncertainty around how bad the\n\n economy will get. The program announced last weekend assumes Greek G.D.P. falls by 4 percent this year, then by\n another 2.6 percent in 2011, before recovering to positive growth in 2012 and beyond.Such figures seem extremely\n\n optimistic, particularly in the face of the civil unrest now sweeping Greece and the deep hostility expressed toward\n\n      <span class=\"unclassified\">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774734 Date: 08/31/2015</span>\n\nGreece in some northern European policy circles.The pattern of growth is critical because, under this program, Greece\nneeds to grow out of its debt problem soon. Greece's debt-to-G.D.P. ratio will be a debilitating 145 percent at the end\n\nof 2011.Now consider putting more realistic growth figures into the I.M.F. forecast for Greece's economy ï¿½ e.g., with\nG.D.P. declining 12 percent in 2011, then the debt-to-G.D.P. ratio may reach 155 percent. At these levels, with a 5\n\npercent real interest rate and no growth, the country needs a primary surplus at 8 percent of G.D.P. to keep the debt-to-\nG.D.P. ratio stable. It will be nowhere near that level. The I.M.F. program has Greece running a primary budget deficit\n\nof around 1 percent of G.D.P. in that year, and that assumes a path for Greek growth that can be regarded only as an\n\"upside scenario.\"The politics of these implied budget surpluses remains brutal. Since most Greek debt is held abroad,\n\nroughly 80 percent of the budget savings the Greek government makes go straight to Germans, French and other foreign\ndebt holders (mostly banks). If growth turns out poorly, will the Greeks be prepared for ever-tougher austerity to pay\n\nthe Germans? Even if everything goes well, Greek citizens seem unlikely to welcome this version of their \"new normal.\"\n\nLast week the European leadership panicked ï¿½ very late in the day ï¿½ when it realized that the euro zone itself was at\n\nrisk of a meltdown. If the euro zone proves unwilling to protect a member like Greece from default, then bond investors\nwill run from Portugal and Spain also ï¿½ if you doubt this, study carefully the interlocking debt picture published\n\nrecently in The New York Times. Higher yields on government debt would have caused concerns about potential bank\nruns in these nations, and then spread to more nations in Europe.When there is such a \"run,\" it is not clear where it\n\nstops. In the hazy distance, Belgium, France, Austria and many others were potentially at risk.\n\nEven the Germans cannot afford to bail out those nations.Slapped in the face by this ugly scenario, the Europeans\ndecided to throw everything they and the I.M.F. had at bailing out Greece.

He is also a\n principal in Salute Capital Management Ltd. Simon Johnson, the former chief economist at the International Monetary\n\n Fund, is the co-author of \"13 Bankers.\"The Greek \"rescue\" package announced last weekend is dramatic, unprecedented\n and far from enough to stabilize the euro zone.The Greek government and the European Union leadership, prodded by\n\n the International Monetary Fund, are 'finally becoming realistic about the dire economic situation in Greece. They have\n abandoned previous rounds of optimistic forecasts and have now admitted to a profoundly worse situation. This new\n\n program calls for \"fiscal adjustments\" ï¿½ cuts to the fiscal deficit, mostly through spending cuts ï¿½ totaling 11 percent of\n gross domestic product in 2010, 4.3 percent in 2011, and 2 percent in 2012 and 2013. The total debt-to-G.D.P. ratio\n\n peaks at 149 percent in 2012-13 before starting a gentle glide path back down to sanity.This new program is honest\n enough to show why it is unlikely to succeed.Daniel Gros, an eminent economist on euro zone issues based in Brussels,\n\n has argued that for each 1 percent of G.D.P. decline in Greek government spending, total demand in the country falls by\n 2.5 percent of G.D.P. If the government reduces spending by 15 percent of G.D.P. ï¿½ the initial shock to demand could\n\n be well over 30 percent of G.D.P.Obviously this simple rule does not work with such large numbers, but it illustrates that\n Greece is likely to experience a very sharp recession ï¿½ and there is substantial uncertainty around how bad the\n\n economy will get. The program announced last weekend assumes Greek G.D.P. falls by 4 percent this year, then by\n another 2.6 percent in 2011, before recovering to positive growth in 2012 and beyond.Such figures seem extremely\n\n optimistic, particularly in the face of the civil unrest now sweeping Greece and the deep hostility expressed toward\n\n      UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774734 Date: 08/31/2015\n\nGreece in some northern European policy circles.The pattern of growth is critical because, under this program, Greece\nneeds to grow out of its debt problem soon. Greece's debt-to-G.D.P. ratio will be a debilitating 145 percent at the end\n\nof 2011.Now consider putting more realistic growth figures into the I.M.F. forecast for Greece's economy ï¿½ e.g., with\nG.D.P. declining 12 percent in 2011, then the debt-to-G.D.P. ratio may reach 155 percent. At these levels, with a 5\n\npercent real interest rate and no growth, the country needs a primary surplus at 8 percent of G.D.P. to keep the debt-to-\nG.D.P. ratio stable. It will be nowhere near that level. The I.M.F. program has Greece running a primary budget deficit\n\nof around 1 percent of G.D.P. in that year, and that assumes a path for Greek growth that can be regarded only as an\n\"upside scenario.\"The politics of these implied budget surpluses remains brutal. Since most Greek debt is held abroad,\n\nroughly 80 percent of the budget savings the Greek government makes go straight to Germans, French and other foreign\ndebt holders (mostly banks). If growth turns out poorly, will the Greeks be prepared for ever-tougher austerity to pay\n\nthe Germans? Even if everything goes well, Greek citizens seem unlikely to welcome this version of their \"new normal.\"\n\nLast week the European leadership panicked ï¿½ very late in the day ï¿½ when it realized that the euro zone itself was at\n\nrisk of a meltdown. If the euro zone proves unwilling to protect a member like Greece from default, then bond investors\nwill run from Portugal and Spain also ï¿½ if you doubt this, study carefully the interlocking debt picture published\n\nrecently in The New York Times. Higher yields on government debt would have caused concerns about potential bank\nruns in these nations, and then spread to more nations in Europe.When there is such a \"run,\" it is not clear where it\n\nstops. In the hazy distance, Belgium, France, Austria and many others were potentially at risk.\n\nEven the Germans cannot afford to bail out those nations.Slapped in the face by this ugly scenario, the Europeans\ndecided to throw everything they and the I.M.F. had at bailing out Greece. The program as announced has only a small\n\nchance of preventing eventual Greek bankruptcy, but it may still slow or avert a dangerous spiral downward ï¿½ and\nenormous collateral damage ï¿½ in the rest of Europe.The I.M.F. floated in some fashion an alternative scenario with a\n\ndebt restructuring, but this was rejected by both the European Union and the Greek authorities.

I look forward to discussing.\n\nGates Says U.S. Lacks Strategy to Curb Iran's Nuclear Drive\n\nBy DAVID E. SANGER and THOM SHANKER\n\nPublished: April 18, 2010\n\nWASHINGTON - Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates has warned in a secret three-page memorandum to top White\nHouse officials that the United States does not have an effective long-range policy for dealing with Iran's steady progress\n\ntoward nuclear capability, according to government officials familiar with the document.\n\nSeveral officials said the highly classified analysis, written in January to President Obama's national security adviser, Gen.\nJames L. Jones, touched off an intense effort inside the Pentagon, the White House and the intelligence agencies to\n\ndevelop new options for Mr. Obama. They include a revised set of military alternatives, still under development, to be\nconsidered should diplomacy and sanctions fail to force Iran to change course.\n\nOfficials familiar with the memo's contents would describe only portions dealing with strategy and policy, and not\n\nsections that apparently dealt with secret operations against Iran, or how to deal with Persian Gulf allies. ï¿½\n\nOne senior official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the memo,\ndescribed the document as \"a wake-up call.\" But White House officials dispute that view, insisting that for 15 months\n\nthey had been conducting detailed planning for many possible outcomes regarding Iran's nuclear program.\n\nIn an interview on Friday, General Jones declined to speak about the memorandum. But he said: \"On Iran, we are doing\nwhat we said we were going to do. The fact that we don't announce publicly our entire strategy for the world to see\n\ndoesn't mean we don't have a strategy that anticipates the full range of contingencies - we do.\"\n\nBut in his memo, Mr. Gates wrote of a variety of concerns, including the absence of an effective strategy should Iran\nchoose the course that many government and outside analysts consider likely: Iran could assemble all the major parts it\n\n needs for a nuclear weapon - fuel, designs and detonators - but stop just short of assembling a fully operational weapon.\n\n In that case, Iran could remain a signatory of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty while becoming what strategists call a\n\n\"virtual\" nuclear weapons state.\n\n According to several officials, the memorandum also calls for new thinking about how the United States might contain\n Iran's power if it decided to produce a weapon, and how to deal with the possibility that fuel or weapons could be\n\n      <span class=\"unclassified\">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774930 Date: 08/31/2015</span>\n\nobtained by one of the terrorist groups Iran has supported, which officials said they considered to be a less-likely\npossibility.\n\nMr. Gates has never mentioned the memo in public. His spokesman, Geoff Morrell, declined comment on specifics in the\n\ndocument, but issued a statement on Saturday saying, \"The secretary believes the president and his national security\nteam have spent an extraordinary amount of time and effort considering and preparing for the full range of\n\ncontingencies with respect to Iran.\"\n\nPressed on the administration's ambiguous phrases until now about how close the United States was willing to allow\nIran's program to proceed, a senior administration official described last week in somewhat clearer terms that there was\n\na line Iran would not be permitted to cross.\n\nThe official said that the United States would ensure that Iran would not \"acquire a nuclear capability,\" a step Tehran\n\ncould get to well before it developed a sophisticated weapon. \"That includes the ability to have a breakout,\" he said,\nusing the term nuclear specialists apply to a country that suddenly renounces the nonproliferation treaty and uses its\n\ntechnology to build a small arsenal.\n\nNearly two weeks ago, Mr. Obama, in an interview with The New York Times, was asked about whether he saw a\ndifference between a nuclear-capable Iran and one that had a fully developed weapon. \"I'm not going to parse that right\n          said. But he noted that North Korea was considered a nuclear-capable state until it threw out inspectors and,\nnow,\" he\nas he said, \"became a self-professed nuclear state.\"\n\nMr. Gates has alluded to his concern that intelligence agencies might miss signals that Iran was taking the final steps\ntoward producing a weapon. Last Sunday on the NBC News program \"Meet the Press,\" he said: \"If their policy is to go to\n\nthe threshold but not assemble a nuclear weapon, how do you tell that they have not assembled? I don't actually know\nhow you would verify that.\" But he cautioned that Iran had run into production difficulties, and he said, \"It's going slow -\n\nslower than they anticipated, but they are moving in that direction.\"\n\nMr. Gates has taken a crucial role in formulating the administration's strategy, and he has been known over his career to\nissue stark warnings against the possibility of strategic surprise.\n\nSome officials said his memo should be    viewed in that light: as a warning to a relatively new president that the United\n\nStates was not adequately prepared.\n\nHe wrote the memo after Iran had let pass a 2009 deadline set by Mr. Obama to respond to his offers of diplomatic\nengagement.\n\n Both that process and efforts to bring new sanctions against Iran have struggled. Administration officials had hoped that\n\nthe revelation by Mr. Obama in September that Iran was building a new uranium enrichment plant inside a mountain\n near Qum would galvanize other nations against Iran, but the reaction was muted. The next three months were spent in\n\nwhat proved to be fruitless diplomatic talks with Iran over a plan to swap much of its low-enriched uranium for fuel for a\n medical reactor in Tehran. By the time Mr. Gates wrote his memo, those negotiations had collapsed.\n\n Mr. Gates's memo appears to reflect concerns in the upper echelons of the Pentagon and the military that the White\n\n House did not have a well-prepared series of alternatives in place in case all the diplomatic steps finally failed. In fact,\n just before Mr. Gates issued his warning, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, wrote an official\n\n \"chairman's guidance\" to his staff saying that while any military option would have \"limited results\" against Iran's\n nuclear facilities, preparations needed to be stepped up.\n\n \"Should the president call for military options, we must have them ready,\" the admiral wrote.\n\n Administration officials testifying before a Senate committee last week made it clear that those preparations were under\n\n way. So did General Jones. \"The president has made it clear from the beginning of this administration that we need to be\n\n       <span class=\"unclassified\">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774930 Date: 08/31/2015</span>\n\nprepared for every possible contingency,\" he said in the interview. \"That is what we have done from day one, while\nsuccessfully building a coalition of nations to isolate Iran and pressure it to live up to its obligations.\"\n\nAt the same hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Lt. Gen. Ronald L. Burgess Jr., director of the Defense\nIntelligence Agency, and Gen. James E. Cartwright, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and one of the military's\n\nmost experienced officers on nuclear matters, said that Iran could produce bomb-grade fuel for at least one nuclear\nweapon within a year, but that it would probably need two to five years to manufacture a workable atomic bomb.\n\nThe administration has been stepping up efforts to contain the influence of Iran and counter its missiles, including\nplacing Patriot anti-missile batteries, mostly\n\t\t\t\t</div></div>",

His spokesman, Geoff Morrell, declined comment on specifics in the\n\ndocument, but issued a statement on Saturday saying, \"The secretary believes the president and his national security\nteam have spent an extraordinary amount of time and effort considering and preparing for the full range of\n\ncontingencies with respect to Iran.\"\n\nPressed on the administration's ambiguous phrases until now about how close the United States was willing to allow\nIran's program to proceed, a senior administration official described last week in somewhat clearer terms that there was\n\na line Iran would not be permitted to cross.\n\nThe official said that the United States would ensure that Iran would not \"acquire a nuclear capability,\" a step Tehran\n\ncould get to well before it developed a sophisticated weapon. \"That includes the ability to have a breakout,\" he said,\nusing the term nuclear specialists apply to a country that suddenly renounces the nonproliferation treaty and uses its\n\ntechnology to build a small arsenal.\n\nNearly two weeks ago, Mr. Obama, in an interview with The New York Times, was asked about whether he saw a\ndifference between a nuclear-capable Iran and one that had a fully developed weapon. \"I'm not going to parse that right\n          said. But he noted that North Korea was considered a nuclear-capable state until it threw out inspectors and,\nnow,\" he\nas he said, \"became a self-professed nuclear state.\"\n\nMr. Gates has alluded to his concern that intelligence agencies might miss signals that Iran was taking the final steps\ntoward producing a weapon. Last Sunday on the NBC News program \"Meet the Press,\" he said: \"If their policy is to go to\n\nthe threshold but not assemble a nuclear weapon, how do you tell that they have not assembled? I don't actually know\nhow you would verify that.\" But he cautioned that Iran had run into production difficulties, and he said, \"It's going slow -\n\nslower than they anticipated, but they are moving in that direction.\"\n\nMr. Gates has taken a crucial role in formulating the administration's strategy, and he has been known over his career to\nissue stark warnings against the possibility of strategic surprise.\n\nSome officials said his memo should be    viewed in that light: as a warning to a relatively new president that the United\n\nStates was not adequately prepared.\n\nHe wrote the memo after Iran had let pass a 2009 deadline set by Mr. Obama to respond to his offers of diplomatic\nengagement.\n\n Both that process and efforts to bring new sanctions against Iran have struggled. Administration officials had hoped that\n\nthe revelation by Mr. Obama in September that Iran was building a new uranium enrichment plant inside a mountain\n near Qum would galvanize other nations against Iran, but the reaction was muted. The next three months were spent in\n\nwhat proved to be fruitless diplomatic talks with Iran over a plan to swap much of its low-enriched uranium for fuel for a\n medical reactor in Tehran. By the time Mr. Gates wrote his memo, those negotiations had collapsed.\n\n Mr. Gates's memo appears to reflect concerns in the upper echelons of the Pentagon and the military that the White\n\n House did not have a well-prepared series of alternatives in place in case all the diplomatic steps finally failed. In fact,\n just before Mr. Gates issued his warning, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, wrote an official\n\n \"chairman's guidance\" to his staff saying that while any military option would have \"limited results\" against Iran's\n nuclear facilities, preparations needed to be stepped up.\n\n \"Should the president call for military options, we must have them ready,\" the admiral wrote.\n\n Administration officials testifying before a Senate committee last week made it clear that those preparations were under\n\n way. So did General Jones. \"The president has made it clear from the beginning of this administration that we need to be\n\n       UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774930 Date: 08/31/2015\n\nprepared for every possible contingency,\" he said in the interview. \"That is what we have done from day one, while\nsuccessfully building a coalition of nations to isolate Iran and pressure it to live up to its obligations.\"\n\nAt the same hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Lt. Gen. Ronald L. Burgess Jr., director of the Defense\nIntelligence Agency, and Gen. James E. Cartwright, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and one of the military's\n\nmost experienced officers on nuclear matters, said that Iran could produce bomb-grade fuel for at least one nuclear\nweapon within a year, but that it would probably need two to five years to manufacture a workable atomic bomb.\n\nThe administration has been stepping up efforts to contain the influence of Iran and counter its missiles, including\nplacing Patriot anti-missile batteries, mostly\n\t\t\t\t"

The Liberal Democrats are unchanged on 21 per cent.\nThe polls tend to fluctuate by a couple of points either way, and these shifts are within the margin of error of the\n\naverage.\nWith other new polls pointing to a firming in Labour support, the party may have enjoyed a small boost from its\n\n manifesto launch. Tory strategists will hope to have achieved a boost from its manifesto launch today.\n If the Populus figures were repeated in the general election in three weeks' time, and there is a uniform switch in votes,\n\n Labour would be the largest single party, with about 300 MPs, ahead of the Tories on 264 and the Lib Dems on 54. This\n would point to a Lab/Lib Dem coalition. But many analysts do not expect a uniform national swing.\n\nThe latest poll shows that 32 per cent of the public now hope for a hung parliament (as opposed to expecting one),\n against 28 per cent wanting a Tory majority and 22 per cent a Labour one..Lib Dem voters prefer a deal with Labour than\n\n the Tories in a hung parliament, by 44 to 31 per cent. The public is evenly split 40 to 42 per cent about whether they\n want Labour or the Tories in either a majority or a minority government.\n\n The poll shows that the number expecting a Tory overall majority has risen by three points to 34 per cent over the past\n week. This only just exceeds the number expecting a hung parliament, at 33 per cent, down six points compared with a\n\n week ago. Overall, 57 per cent expect the Tories to be the largest party, against 29 per cent expecting Labour to be.\n\n       <span class=\"unclassified\">UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774903 Date: 08/31/2015</span>\n\nThe public is deeply sceptical about the honesty of the parties. Only 4 per cent think that they are being completely\n\nhonest about their tax plans, 61 per cent partly honest. Only 6 per cent say they are being completely honest about\ncutting the deficit and 61 per cent partly honest. Some 7 per cent say that they are being completely honest about the\n\nextent to which they can fund their policies by cutting waste and 58 per cent partly honest.\nVoters were asked to say which party had proposed eight key manifesto pledges. They wrongly identified four: reducing\n\nthe increase in national insurance contributions (naming Labour not the Tories); allowing unsuccessful schools, hospitals\nand the police (the Tories, not Labour); tightening up takeover rules (the Tories not Labour); and requiring foreign\n\nworkers employed in public services to speak fluent English (the Tories not Labour).\nIn only one case, the ï¿½150-a-year tax break, did more than half of voters (60 per cent) correctly identify the party making\n\nthe proposal.\nIn most cases, the pledge will make little difference to people's votes, apart from three made by Labour: the foreign\n\nworkers language pledge, doubling paid paternity leave and allowing the takover of unsuccessful schools, hospitals etc.\n\nMore than two fifths (43 per cent), including 50 per cent of women, say \"none of the parties\", or \"don't know\", when\nasked which party is putting across a convincing cases to voters. This compares with 25 per cent naming the Tories and\n\n18 per cent Labour.\nJust over half the public (54 per cent) plan to watch the first televised leaders' debate on Thursday evening. Men and\n\nmiddle class professionals are more likely to say that they will view. More than two fifths (42 per cent) expect David\nCameron to win the debate, against 22 per cent for Gordon Brown. More Tories (70 per cent) than Labour voters ( 57\n\nper cent) expect their leader to win.\nTwo fifths of the public (42 per cent, up one point on a week ago) say it seems like a change from Labour, but are not\n\nsure that it is time for a change to the Conservatives. Some 33 per cent, down one point, think it is time for a change to\nthe Tories.\n\nPopulus interviewed a random sample of 1,525 adult voters on April 12 to 13. Interviews were conducted across the\ncountry and have been weighted to be representative of all adults.
