  "body": "# New York Data City\r\nNYDC is a project that explores the conventional aspects of data representation. Data visualization is frequently used to convey information using highly abstracted visual and vocabulary symbols. In some cases, humans can only interpret data only because a symbolic reference is provide along the visualization.\r\n\r\nData visualization can be politicized and manipulated through symbols. It can force the viewer to interpret the data in a very intentional and particular way. The semantic symbols in a data visualization, can sometimes become the most significant factor to dictate the viewer’s interpretation of the data. People frequently use terms like “let data speak for itself” as a substitute to meaningful informational representation. Data can be represented in more abstract forms that may convey its inherit nature and its meaningfulness.\r\n\r\n[Visual 01](https://mbrav.github.io/nydc/01/index.html) - NYC Farmer Markets ([data source](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/New-York-City-Farmers-Markets/j8gx-kc43/data))\r\n\r\n[Visual 02](https://mbrav.github.io/nydc/02/index.html) - NYC Water Complaints ([data source](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Water-Quality-complaints/qfe3-6dkn/data))\r\n\r\n[Visual 03](https://mbrav.github.io/nydc/03/index.html) - NYC Greenthumb Community Gardens ([data source](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/NYC-Greenthumb-Community-Gardens/ajxm-kzmj))\r\n\r\n[Visual 04](https://mbrav.github.io/nydc/04/index.html) - NYC Cool Roof Buildings ([data source](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/NYC-Cool-Roofs-Buildings/uuxn-wzxe/data))\r\n\r\n[Visual 05](https://mbrav.github.io/nydc/05/index.html) - NYC Food Scrap Drop Of Sites ([data source](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Food-Scrap-Drop-Off-Sites/rmmq-46n5/data))\r\n\r\n[Visual 06](https://mbrav.github.io/nydc/06/index.html) - NYC Projects in Construction ([data source](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/Housing-Development/Projects-in-Construction-Map/dzgh-ja44/data))\r\n\r\n[Visual 07](https://mbrav.github.io/nydc/07/index.html) - .nyc Domain Registration by Zip Code ([data source](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Business/-nyc-Domain-Registrations-by-Zip-Code/ymvu-4x4s/data))\r\n\r\n[Visual 08](https://mbrav.github.io/nydc/08/index.html) - NYC Approved Wholesale Markets ([data source](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Business/Approved-registrants-in-the-wholesale-markets/sapz-4gsi))\r\n\r\n[Visual 09](https://mbrav.github.io/nydc/09/index.html) - NYC Public Recycling Bins ([data source](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Public-Recycling-Bins/sxx4-xhzg/data))\r\n\r\n[Visual 10](https://mbrav.github.io/nydc/10/index.html) - NYC Health and Hospital Corporation (HHC) Facilities ([data source](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/NYC-Health-and-Hospitals-Corporation-Facilities/ymhw-9cz9/data))\r\n\r\n[Visual 11](https://mbrav.github.io/nydc/11/index.html) - NYDC Combined visualization\r\n\r\n![11 - NYDC Combined visualization](http://i.imgur.com/qU7KqxJ.png)\r\n\r\n## Instructions\r\n\r\nUse the ```W```,```A```,```S```, and```D``` keys to navigate forwards, left , back, and right.\r\n\r\nUse ```Q``` and ```E``` to rotate the camera.\r\n\r\nUse the mouse to stir the direction.\r\n\r\n**Does not yet support mobile device movement**  \r\n\r\n## Process\r\n\r\n[utils](https://github.com/mbrav/nydc/tree/master/utils) - a set of utilities that where used for geocoding and parsing the data.\r\n\r\nThe converted data can be [found here](https://github.com/mbrav/nydc/tree/master/data) as .js files.\r\n\r\nSome of the parts of this project are based on [graffiti-data](https://github.com/mbrav/nydc/tree/master/graffiti).\r\n\r\nGeocoding [NYC Greenthumb Community Gardens](https://youtu.be/WlM96wBV5nU) using Google's API\r\n\r\nGeocoding [NYC Farmer Markets](https://youtu.be/byGIZ4QIHOM) using Google's API\r\n\r\n### Made with\r\n\r\n* [three.js](https://threejs.org/) and WebGL\r\n* [NYC Open Data](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/) \r\n\r\n## Influence\r\n\r\nCao Fei's - [RMB City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MhfATPZA0g)\r\n\r\nCao Fei's - [China Tracy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vcR7OkzHkI)\r\n",
